(/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.\\nTesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla\\'s largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to sell 1\\xa0million units globally.[6] In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally.[7] In January 2024, the Model Y became the best-selling BEV in history.[citation needed]\\nTesla is one of the world\\'s most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world\\'s most valuable automaker. In October 2021, Tesla temporarily became a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to do so, and did so again in November 2024.[8] In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.[9]\\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company\\'s driving assist technology and product release timelines.\\n\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Tesla, Inc.\\nTesla Motors insignia as seen on a Tesla Roadster, c.\\u20092010\\nFounding (2003–2004)\\nThe company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[10][11] They served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively.[12] Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".[13]\\nIan Wright was Tesla\\'s third employee, joined a few months later.[10] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5\\xa0million (equivalent to $12\\xa0million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5\\xa0million (equivalent to $10\\xa0million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100\\xa0million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[14][15][12] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[16]\\nA lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[17]\\n\\nRoadster (2005–2009)\\nMain article: Tesla Roadster (first generation)\\nElon Musk took an active role within the company, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[18] The company\\'s strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[19]\\nIn February 2006, Musk led Tesla\\'s Series B venture capital funding round of $13\\xa0million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[20][15] Musk co-led the third, $40\\xa0million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[21] A fourth round worth $45\\xa0million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105\\xa0million.[21]\\nIn August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[22] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[23] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze\\'ev Drori became CEO and president.[24] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[24] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[25] The case was dismissed in August 2009.[26]\\nTesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[27][28] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187\\xa0million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70\\xa0million of his money to the company.[29]\\nIn June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465\\xa0million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8\\xa0billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[30] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12\\xa0million in interest.[31][32]\\n\\nIPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015)\\nFirst deliveries of Model S at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, in June 2012\\nIn May 2010, Tesla purchased the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California from Toyota for $42\\xa0million.[33] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[34] The company issued 13.3\\xa0million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226\\xa0million.[35]\\nIn October 2010, Tesla opened the Tesla Factory to start production of the Model S.[36] In January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June 2012, the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[37] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[38] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it topped the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[39] The Model S was also the best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[40]\\nOn July 15, 2013, Tesla became a NASDAQ-100 company.[41]\\nTesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[42]\\nTesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[43] The company received orders valued at $800\\xa0million within a week of the unveiling.[44]\\nTesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[45][46]\\n\\nSolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018)\\nTesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6\\xa0billion deal.[47] The business was merged with Tesla\\'s existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary.[48] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla\\'s shareholders were not informed.[49] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business.[50]\\nTesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla\\'s previous three vehicles, and within a week, the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[51] To speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[52] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company described as \"production hell\".[53][54] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 became the world\\'s best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[55][56]\\nThis period of \"production hell\" put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[57][58] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step down as the company\\'s chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO.\\n\\nGlobal expansion and Model Y (2019–present)\\nFrom July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[59] During 2020, its share price increased 740%,[60] and by December 14, 2020, its market capitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined,[61] and it became the sixth most valuable company in the US.[62] Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020;[63] it was the most valuable company ever added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added.[63][64]\\nTesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model 3.[65][66] Deliveries started in March 2020.[67]\\nDuring this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[68] The factory\\'s first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[69] Gigafactory Berlin broke ground in February 2020,[70] and its production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[71] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[72] and its production of the Model Y began in April 2022.[73] In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025,[74] but its groundbreaking has been delayed.\\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and Alameda county COVID restrictions.[75] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county, and restarted production on May 11, 2020.[76] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its lawsuit.[77] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[78][79] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[80] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[81]\\nIn early 2021, Tesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5\\xa0billion of the cryptocurrency,[82] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[83] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company\\'s mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[84] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[85] Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume bitcoin payments if there was confirmation of at least 50% clean energy usage by bitcoin miners. Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla did not return to accepting bitcoin.[86][87] By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company\\'s profitability.[88]\\nBetween May 2023 and February 2024, almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to Tesla\\'s North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by 2025, which is expected to be a stable source of recurring revenue for Tesla.[89] In November, Tesla started shipping the Cybertruck, produced from Gigafactory Texas.[90]\\nIn April 2024, the company announced it was laying off 10% of its employees.[91] In June, the company moved its incorporation from Delaware to Texas.[92] In October, the company unveiled a concept version of two autonomous vehicles – the Cybercab and Robovan – and detailed that both would be an integral part of a Tesla ridehailing service called the Tesla Network,[93] [94] a future service they had previously teased in 2019.[95]\\n\\nAutomotive products and services\\n\"Tesla electric car\" redirects here.

Development of the Model S began before 2007 and deliveries started in June 2012. The Model S has seen two major design refreshes, first in April 2016, which introduced a new front-end design and again in June 2021, which revised the interior. The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016. More than 250,000 vehicles have been sold as of December\\xa02018[update] (when Tesla merged production numbers for the Model S and Model X).\\n\\nModel X\\nMain article: Tesla Model X\\nTesla Model X\\nThe Model X is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV offered in 5-, 6- and 7-passenger configurations with either a dual- or trimotor, all-wheel drive layout. The rear passenger doors open vertically with an articulating \"falcon-wing\" design. A prototype Model X was first shown in February 2012 and deliveries started in September 2015.[96] The Model X shares around 30 percent of its content with the Model S. The vehicle has seen one major design refresh in June 2021 which revised the interior.\\n\\nModel 3\\nMain article: Tesla Model 3\\nTesla Model 3\\nThe Model 3 is a mid-size car with a fastback body style and either a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout or a rear-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model S sedan. A prototype Model 3 was first shown in 2016 and within a week, the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[51] Deliveries started in July 2017.[97] The Model 3 ranked as the world\\'s best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021,[98][99][100] and cumulative sales passed 1\\xa0million in June 2021.[6] The vehicle has seen one major design refresh in September 2023 which revised the exterior and interior.\\n\\nModel Y\\nMain article: Tesla Model Y\\nTesla Model Y\\nThe Model Y is a mid-size crossover SUV offered in 5- and 7-passenger configurations with a single‐motor, rear-wheel drive or a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model X SUV. A prototype Model Y was first shown in March 2019,[65] and deliveries started in March 2020.[67] The Model Y shared around 75 percent of its content with the Model 3.[66] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y outsold the Toyota Corolla to become the world\\'s best-selling car, the first electric vehicle to claim the title.[101]\\n\\nTesla Semi\\nMain article: Tesla Semi\\nTesla Semi prototype\\nThe Tesla Semi is a Class 8 semi-truck by Tesla, Inc. with a tri-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. Tesla claims that the Semi has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, and a range of 500 miles (800\\xa0km).[102] Two prototype trucks were first shown in November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022.[103] Tesla stated in April 2024 that it plans full production in late 2025.[104]\\n\\nCybertruck\\nMain article: Tesla Cybertruck\\nTesla Cybertruck\\nThe Cybertruck is a full-sized pickup truck. First announced in November 2019, pilot production began in July 2023, after being pushed back multiple times, and deliveries began on November 30, 2023. Three models are offered: rear-wheel drive, dual-motor all-wheel drive, and trimotor all-wheel drive, with EPA range estimates of 320–340 miles (510–550\\xa0km), depending on the model. The truck\\'s exterior design made from flat sheets of unpainted stainless steel earned a notably polarizing reception from media.[105][106][107]\\n\\nAnnounced products\\nRoadster (second generation)\\nMain article: Tesla Roadster (second generation)\\nTesla Roadster prototype\\nOn November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000\\xa0km) with a 200-kilowatt-hour (720\\xa0MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0–60 miles per hour (0–97\\xa0km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0–100\\xa0mph (0–161\\xa0km/h) in 4.2 seconds,[108] and a top speed over 250\\xa0mph (400\\xa0km/h). A \"SpaceX Package\" would include cold-gas thrusters.[109] The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.[109] The base price was set at $200,000.[109] Initially scheduled to ship in 2020, the vehicle has been repeatedly delayed. In July 2024, Musk said that the Roadster should enter production in 2025.[110]\\n\\nTesla next-generation vehicle\\nMain article: Tesla next-generation vehicle\\nThe Tesla next-generation vehicle is an announced battery electric platform. It would become the third platform for the company. Vehicles based on this platform are not expected before 2025.[111] In July 2024, Musk said that the vehicle should be available for delivery in the first half of 2025.[110]\\n\\nCybercab\\nTesla Cybercab prototype\\nMain article: Tesla Cybercab\\nThe Tesla Cybercab, also known as the Robotaxi, is an upcoming two-passenger battery-electric self-driving car under development by Tesla. The vehicle will be fully autonomously controlled, and has no steering wheel or pedals.\\nA concept version of the Cybercab was unveiled in October 2024, with 20 prototypes providing short rides to attendees of the announcement event.  Production is planned to commence sometime before 2027.\\n\\nRobovan\\nMain article: Tesla RobovanThe Tesla Robovan is an electric autonomous van planned for future development by Tesla.[112]  Announced in October 2024, the vehicle is being designed to carry up to 20 passengers.[94]\\nDiscontinued Tesla Roadster\\nMain article: Tesla Roadster (first generation)\\nThe original Roadster\\nThe original Tesla Roadster[113] was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis.[114] It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320\\xa0km) per charge.\\n\\nConnectivity services\\nTesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming.[115]\\n\\nVehicle servicing\\nTesla\\'s strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, a mobile technician is dispatched or customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center.[116][117] As of October\\xa02024[update], the company operates 1,306 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[118] Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.[119]\\nIn 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[120]\\n\\n Charging services\\n Supercharger network\\nMain article: Tesla Supercharger\\nSupercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers.\\n\\n\\nTesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg, Germany.\\nThe Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with six sites in California and Nevada. As of July\\xa02024[update], Tesla operates a network of 6,500 Supercharger stations with nearly 60,000 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,650 stations), North America (over 2,550), and Europe (over 1,200). Since 2019 most superchargers deployed have been able to output as much as 250 kilowatts (kW). As of January\\xa02024[update] approximately 68% of chargers have V3 or V4 stalls capable of outputting this amount.\\nDestination charging location network\\n\"Destination Charger\" in North America\\nTesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers\", slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners set up the devices and set pricing.[121] When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs.[citation needed] One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[122]\\n\\nInsurance services\\nTesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since 2017 and has been acting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. It was introduced after the American Automobile Association (AAA), a major insurance carrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the automakers vehicles crashed more often and were pricier to repair than comparable vehicles.[123] A study in 2018 based on data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety confirmed the findings.[124]\\nThe company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers\\' additional charges.[125] In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month\\'s driving safety score.[126]\\nAs of January\\xa02023[update], Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia.[127] The company also offers insurance for non-Tesla vehicles owned by Tesla owners.[125]\\n\\nEnergy products\\nMain article: Tesla Energy\\nTwo Tesla Powerwall 2 home energy storage devices from Tesla Energy\\nTesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla\\'s existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[128] In 2023, the company deployed 14.7 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 125% over 2022, but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223 megawatts, a decrease of 36% over 2022.[129]\\nTesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the Tesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products include the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage system).[130][131][132]\\nFor large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[133][134][135] In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2\\xa0GWh of storage.[136] For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company\\'s online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.[137][138]\\n\\nBusiness strategy\\nRobotic manufacturing of the Model S at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California\\nAt the time of Tesla\\'s founding in 2003, electric vehicles were costly.[139] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla\\'s strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[19][140] Tesla\\'s first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[141][142] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, unlike nearly every other car manufacturer.[143]\\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[144][145] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[146][147] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says, \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[148][149] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[150] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[145] instead of near other auto dealerships.[151][152][153]\\nAnalysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[154] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[155][156][157]\\nTesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world\\'s use of sustainable energy.[158] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[159] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[160]\\nOn April 15, 2024, Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips, marking a significant step in Tesla\\'s expansion into India\\'s automotive market.[161]\\nOn May 2, 2024, Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for next-generation gigacasting, a cutting-edge manufacturing technique. Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs, Tesla has now opted for its more proven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces. This strategic shift reflects the company\\'s focus on self-driving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges.\\n[162]\\n\\nTechnology\\nTesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[154]\\n\\n Batteries\\nTesla vehicle chassis used in Model S and X, with the battery visible\\nComparison of Tesla\\'s three cylindrical battery cell form factors\\nAs of 2023, Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors: 18650, 2170, 4680, and prismatic.[163][164][165]\\nTesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla\\'s Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries.\\nTesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multipart aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes.[166]\\nBusiness analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla\\'s battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[167]\\n\\n18650\\nTesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18\\xa0mm diameter, 65\\xa0mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[168] However, the decision turned out to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic\\'s factories in Japan.[169]\\n\\n2170\\nThe next battery type to be used was the 2170-type (21\\xa0mm diameter, 70\\xa0mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[169]\\nFor vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic\\'s production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[170] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[171] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product.\\nFor vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution\\'s factories in China.[169]\\n\\n4680\\nTesla\\'s latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46\\xa0mm diameter, 80\\xa0mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[172][173] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[169]\\n\\nPrismatic\\nTesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[169] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[174] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL\\'s factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla\\'s vehicle production used prismatic cells.[175] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[176]\\n\\nResearch\\nTesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[177] Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million[178] – and sold in 2021.[179] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[180][181] Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.[182][183]\\n\\nSoftware\\nTesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[184] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[185]\\nThe system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn\\'t pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[186] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[187]\\n\\nMotors\\nTesla makes two kinds of electric motors: an induction motor, and an internal permanent magnet (IPM) motor with synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) characteristics.\\nThe older design is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (also called an asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor (which inspired the Tesla logo).[188] These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster.\\nSince the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017, Tesla has also been building IPM-SynRM motors. These motors use an iron rotor, with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent starting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to counter-electromotive forces. For high-speed operation, Tesla engineers used iron\\'s reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the stator if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted.[189][190] The IPM-SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[191]\\n\\n North American Charging Standard\\nMain article: North American Charging Standard\\nThe North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicles charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[192]\\n\\nAutopilot and Full Self-Driving\\nThis section is an excerpt from Tesla Autopilot.[edit]\\nTesla Autopilot in operation\\nTesla Autopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) developed by Tesla that amounts to partial vehicle automation (Level 2 automation, as defined by SAE International). Tesla provides \"Base Autopilot\" on all vehicles, which includes lane centering and traffic-aware cruise control. Owners may purchase or subscribe to Full Self-Driving (FSD) which adds semi-autonomous navigation that responds to traffic lights and stop signs, lane change assistance, self-parking, and the ability to summon the car from a garage or parking spot.\\nThe company\\'s stated intent is to offer fully autonomous driving (SAE Level 5) at a future time, acknowledging that technical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal.[193] The names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving are controversial, because vehicles remain at Level 2 automation and are therefore not \"fully self-driving\" and require active driver supervision.\\nThe company claims the features reduce accidents caused by driver negligence and fatigue from long-term driving.[194][195] Collisions and deaths involving Tesla cars with Autopilot engaged have drawn the attention of the press and government agencies.[196] Industry observers and academics have criticized Tesla\\'s decision to use untrained consumers to validate beta features as dangerous and irresponsible.[197][198][199][200]\\n\\nSince 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly made inaccurate predictions for Tesla to achieve Level 5 autonomy within one to three years,[201] most recently predicting the end of 2023.[202]\\nGlass\\nIn November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof\\'s solar shingles.[203]\\n\\nRobotics\\nIn preparation for Model 3 production, Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly, and between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[204] Grohmann Automation,[205] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[206] Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[52]\\nSubsequently, Tesla shifted towards using massive casting machines, known as Giga Presses. These machines streamline production by creating large, single-piece underbodies, leading to reductions in production time, labor costs, factory footprint, and the number of welding robots.[207][208] Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the vehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident.[209]\\nThe company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since 2022. Musk has stated that Optimus leverages the same core software powering Tesla\\'s Full Self-Driving technology and has suggested that it could be used within Tesla\\'s factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks.[210]\\n\\nFacilities\\nSee also: List of Tesla factories\\nThe company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of October\\xa02024[update], the company also operates more than 1,300 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[118]\\n\\n\\nPrimary facilities operated by Tesla\\n\\n\\nOpened\\n\\nName\\n\\nCity\\n\\nCountry\\n\\nEmployees\\n\\nProducts\\n\\nRef.\\n\\n\\n2010\\n\\nTesla Fremont Factory\\n\\nFremont, California\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\n22,000\\n\\nModel\\xa0S, Model\\xa0X, Model\\xa03, Model\\xa0Y\\n\\n[33][211][212]\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\nGigafactory Nevada\\n\\nStorey County, Nevada\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\n7,000\\n\\nBatteries, Powerwall, Semi\\n\\n[213][214][215]\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\nGigafactory New York\\n\\nBuffalo, New York\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\n1,500\\n\\nSolar\\xa0Roof, Supercharger\\n\\n[216][217]\\n\\n\\n2019\\n\\nGigafactory Shanghai\\n\\nShanghai\\n\\nChina\\n\\n20,000\\n\\nModel\\xa03, Model\\xa0Y, Supercharger\\n\\n[218][219]\\n\\n\\n2022\\n\\nGigafactory Berlin\\n\\nGrünheide\\n\\nGermany\\n\\n10,000\\n\\nModel\\xa0Y\\n\\n[220][221][222]\\n\\n\\n2022\\n\\nGigafactory Texas\\n\\nAustin, Texas\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\n12,000\\n\\nModel\\xa0Y, Cybertruck\\n\\n[223][224][225]\\n\\nNorth America\\nMain articles: Tesla Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory New York, Gigafactory Texas, and Gigafactory Mexico\\nNew Tesla Model S cars at the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2012\\nTesla was founded in San Carlos, California in 2003.[226] In 2008, the company opened its first production facility at a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park, California. The original roadster was assembled inside the service bays until 2012 and used the company showroom as a retail store.[227] Another retail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year.[228] In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[229]\\nTesla\\'s first major assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[230] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[33]\\n\\nGigafactory Nevada in 2019\\nTesla\\'s first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces the Powerwall,[213] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic,[231] Model 3 drivetrains,[232] and the Tesla Semi.[233] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax-free for 10 years,[234] later extended to 20 years in exchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi and add additional battery manufacturing capacity.[233]\\nAs part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[235][236] In 2017, the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[216] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding.[237]\\nIn 2018, Tesla assembled tension fabric buildings at the Fremont plant to meet production goals of 5,000 cars produced a month. The structure was assembled in two weeks and measured 53 feet high, 150 feet wide, and 900 feet long.[238]\\n\\nGigafactory Texas in 2022\\nOn July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory Texas.[239] Giga Texas is the only factory that produces the Tesla Cybertruck and produces Model Y cars for the Eastern United States.  On December 1, 2021, Tesla announced it relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto to the Gigafactory Texas site in Austin.[240] However, Tesla has retained the Palo Alto building. On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of Gigafactory Texas in a public event.[73]\\nTesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California, in 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the company\\'s large-scale energy storage product.[241][242] The location opened in 2022.\\nTesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla\\'s former headquarters building.[243]\\nTesla has announced plans to open a Gigafactory Mexico, the company\\'s sixth Gigafactory, near Monterrey, Mexico. However, as of July\\xa02024[update], the company has placed construction on hold until after the 2024 United States presidential election because former President Trump has pledged to add tariffs on cars made in Mexico.[244]\\n\\nEurope\\nMain articles: Tesla facilities in Tilburg and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg\\nGigafactory Berlin in July\\xa02023\\nTesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[245] Tesla\\'s European headquarters are in the Netherlands,[246] part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg, including the company\\'s European Distribution Centre.[247]\\nIn late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.[248] After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.[249]\\nTesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016.[250] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[251] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[252] On March 22, 2022, Tesla\\'s first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin[253][254] opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[254]\\n\\nAsia\\nMain article: Gigafactory Shanghai\\nTesla store in Tokyo, the first in Asia[255]\\nTesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[256]\\nIn July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla\\'s first Gigafactory outside the United States.[257] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019.[218] In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second-largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales.[258]\\nTesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country.[259] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023.[260]\\n\\nPartners\\nPanasonic\\nPanasonic Energy president Naoto Noguchi presents Tesla executive JB Straubel with lithium-ion cells\\nIn January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles.[261] Beginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30\\xa0million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles.[262] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[263] Tesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[216] The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[264][265]\\nIn March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.[266]\\n\\nOther current partners\\nTesla has long-term contracts in place for lithium supply. In September 2020, Tesla signed a sales agreement with Piedmont Lithium to buy high-purity lithium ore for up to ten years,[267] specifically to supply \"spodumene concentrate from Piedmont\\'s North Carolina mineral deposit\".[268] In 2022, Tesla contracted for 110,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate over four years from the Core Lithium\\'s lithium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia.[269]\\nTesla also has a range of minor partnerships, for instance working with Airbnb and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations.[270]\\n\\nFormer partners\\nDaimler\\nThe Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive used a Tesla-supplied battery pack.[271]\\nDaimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50\\xa0million.[272][273] As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat.[274] On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.[275] In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780\\xa0million.[276]\\nTesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010.[277][278] The company also built electric-powertrain components for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.[279][280] Tesla produced and co-developed the Mercedes-Benz B250e\\'s powertrain, which ended production in 2017.[281] The electric motor was rated 134\\xa0hp (100\\xa0kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310\\xa0N⋅m), with a 36\\xa0kWh (130\\xa0MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200\\xa0km (124\\xa0mi) with a top speed of 150\\xa0km/h (93\\xa0mph).[282] Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50\\xa0MJ) lithium-ion battery from Tesla.[283][284]\\n\\nToyota\\nToyota RAV4 EV, which used a Tesla-supplied battery and powertrain components\\nIn May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for $42\\xa0million, Toyota purchased $50\\xa0million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.[33]\\nIn July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV.[285] The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components[286][287] based on components from the Roadster.[288]\\nThe production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012).[289] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[290][291]\\nAccording to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[292] Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV\\'s battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure\\'s design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan\\'s battery after some debris-related crashes led to cars catching fire.[292][166] On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[293][294]\\n\\nMobileye\\nInitial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[295] Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed.\"[296]\\n\\nLawsuits and controversies\\nMain articles: List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc. and Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\\nSexual harassment\\nIn 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla\\'s Fremont factory.[297] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,\" Brooks told The Washington Post. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[298]\\nWomen feared calling Human Resources for help, as their supervisors were often participants.[299] Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women\\'s bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[300] \"What we\\'re addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[299] In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had terminated her employment, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee\\'s allegations with the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[301]\\nIn May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla\\'s request for closed-door arbitration.[302]\\n\\nLabor disputes\\nSee also: Tesla and unions\\nUnited States\\nIn June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) took issue with Tesla\\'s use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) regarding customer repairs[303] and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta.[304] Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees[305] and customers[306] to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.[307][308]\\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Tesla\\'s Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[309] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[310]\\nIn January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees\\' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders.[311][312][313] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[314][315] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[316] In 2020, the court ordered Hansen\\'s case to arbitration.[317] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims… Accordingly, his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing\".[318]\\nIn September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.[319][320]\\nIn March 2021, the US National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over union organization activities.[321][322] Later, after appealing, a federal appeals court upheld the decision.[323]\\nThe California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla Fremont factory.

The strike initially involved approximately 120 mechanics at ten workshops servicing Tesla vehicles and later expanded via solidarity strikes to include services provided by postmen, electricians, and other workers involved with Tesla operations.[325][326][327]\\nIn September 2024, in an attempt to crack down on worker absenteeism, Tesla\\'s Berlin-area factory conducted unannounced visits to the homes of employees out on sick leave.[328]\\n\\nFraud allegations\\nThere have been numerous concerns about Tesla\\'s financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether Tesla\\'s financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[329] Fortune accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[330] In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla\\'s accounts receivable balance.[331] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla\\'s warranty reserves and lease accounting.[332] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of \"significant fraud\",[333][334] and publicly questioned Tesla\\'s accounting practices, telling Musk that he was \"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[335]\\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295\\xa0million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.[336] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[337]\\nA consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[338] The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[339] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk,[340][341] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[342]\\nIn August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[343] The tweet caused the stock to initially rise, but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[344][345][346] Musk settled fraud charges with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla\\'s in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company\\'s board.[347] Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20\\xa0million each.[347] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk\\'s statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla\\'s board of directors, as then constituted, regarding claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[348][349] In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[350]\\nIn September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures.[351] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[351] A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019.[352][353][354]\\nIn May 2024, Reuters reported that US federal prosecutors were investigating whether the company committed securities or wire fraud by \"misleading investors and consumers\" about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.[355]\\n\\nTesla US dealership disputes\\nSee also: Tesla US dealership disputes\\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[148] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their dealers.[151] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations\\' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[356][357][358]\\nTesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[359] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[148] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[151] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[119]\\n\\nIntellectual property\\nIn January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account.[360] Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a \"willful and malicious thief\" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer.[361] The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.[362]\\nTesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox;[363] for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account;[364] Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla.[365]\\n\\nMisappropriation\\nIn 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla\\'s board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk\\'s stock-based compensation plan.[349] Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700\\xa0million in May 2020.[366]\\nIn July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020.[367]\\n\\nEnvironmental violations\\nIn 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017.[368] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District;[369] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont\\'s paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019.[370] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla\\'s Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[371]\\nIn June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[372] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla\\'s security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[373][311] The court ruled in Tesla\\'s favor on September 17, 2020.[374][375]\\nIn January 2024, 25 California counties sued Tesla, accusing the company of violating state health and safety codes by illegally disposing of hazardous waste. Later that week, the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay US$1.5 million and admit to acting \"intentionally\" and \"negligent\". Moreover, Tesla also agreed to train its employees on hazardous waste disposal and to have 10 percent of Tesla\\'s facilities audited for waste disposal for the next 5 years.[376][377][378]\\n\\nProperty damage\\nIn August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla\\'s \"negligent installation and maintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[379] Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[380]\\nIn April 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, after they failed to respond to the lawsuit. The 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit were awarded 136,000 Norwegian kroner each ($16,000).[381][382]\\n\\nRacism\\nTesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[383][384] with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior\".[385] As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American.[386] A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla\\'s Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place\".[387] Tesla and SpaceX\\'s treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire.[388] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[389] According to the state\\'s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial[390] and physically demanding work.[391] The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for \"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[392]\\nIn July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1\\xa0million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[393]\\nIn October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff $137\\xa0million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla\\'s Fremont facility during 2015–2016.[394][395] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never \"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most uttering of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[396][397] In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla\\'s liability but reduced the total damage down to $15\\xa0million.[398] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15\\xa0million award, opening the door for a new trial.[399] In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[400]\\nFew of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[401] Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors.\\n\\nCOVID-19 pandemic\\nTesla\\'s initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government\\'s stay-at-home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[402] He had also called the public\\'s response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[403] In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[404][405][406] Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[407][408] In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[409] however some employees still expressed concern for their health.[410]\\nIn May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[411] But in June, Tesla dismissed an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[412] Three more employees at Tesla\\'s Fremont Factory claimed they were laid off for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[413] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[402][414]\\nIn China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work\\xa0– but a flashing-sirens police escort.\"[415] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[415] Musk has praised China\\'s way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.–Chinese relations, the Persecution of Uyghurs in China, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[415]\\n\\nRight to repair\\nIn March 2023, a class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against Tesla by Virginia M. Lambrix in San Francisco, California, alleging that the company unlawfully monopolized the market for maintenance and repair of its vehicles in violation of the Sherman Act and California antitrust law, as a result of which owners were \"forced to pay supracompetitive prices and suffer exorbitant wait times\" for maintenance services and repair parts.[416][417] The lawsuit was later combined with four other similar suits.[418][419]\\nWhile six out of eight alleged antitrust violations were dismissed, in June 2024 US District Judge Trina Thompson allowed two claims to proceed, including alleged violations of California\\'s Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law (UCL), with the court finding evidence of a repairs monopoly in Tesla\\'s designing of its vehicles to require diagnostic and software updates that only the company could provide, and evidence of a parts monopoly in Tesla\\'s restricting original equipment manufacturers from selling \"to anyone other than Tesla.\"[418][419]\\n\\nCriticism\\nMain article: Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\\nData privacy\\nTesla was only the second product ever reviewed by the Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns.[420][421]\\nA Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers\\' car cameras\" with one another.[422]\\nInternal data troves shared with various international government agencies and news organizations by former employee and whistleblower Lukasz Krupski in late 2023 implicated Tesla in \"serious data protection lapse[s].\"[423] The data Krupski retrieved included \"information about current and former Tesla staff, including passport numbers, medical details and salaries\" and was readily available on internal systems that most employees had access to.[424] As of November 2023, the Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands is investigating whether Tesla\\'s alleged lack of internal security violated privacy laws.[425]\\n\\nShort sellers\\nTSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to \"shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[426] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets.[427] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40\\xa0billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher.[428] Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in The Big Short, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[429]\\n\\nTesla\\'s mission\\nAccording to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[430]\\n\\nGiga New York audit\\nIn 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state.[431][432][433]\\n\\nDelays\\nMusk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[434][435] By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[436] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December.[437] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[438] Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well.[439] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have also lagged projections.[440] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it\\'s gonna get done?\"[441]\\n\\nVehicle product issues\\nRecalls\\nOn April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[442][443] On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[444]\\nIn October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues.[445] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X years. Cases of the \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.[446][447]\\nIn February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[448] The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rearview camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[449][450] The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.[451]\\nAlso in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of \"body mouldings problems\".[452][453]\\nIn June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.[454]\\nOn December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S\\' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[455] After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.[456]\\nIn September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1\\xa0million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[457][458] In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[458]\\nIn February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars.[459] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[460] In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars\\' second-row seats.[461]\\nIn December 2023, following a 2-year-long investigation by the NHTSA,[462] Tesla issued a wider recall on all vehicles equipped with any version of Autosteer, including 2012–2023 Model S; 2016–2023 Model X; 2017–2023 Model 3; and 2020–2023 Model Y, covering 2,031,220 vehicles in total.[463] The NHTSA concluded that Autosteer\\'s controls were not sufficient to prevent misuse and did not ensure that the drivers maintained \"continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operation\" and states that affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software remedy.[463][464]\\n\\nFires\\nSee also: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents §\\xa0Tesla\\nTesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[465] In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[466] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[467] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[468] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4\\xa0mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[469] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla\\'s Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-crash\" fires.[470][471][472]\\n\\nAutopilot crashes\\nSee also: List of Tesla Autopilot crashes\\nA Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[473][474] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[475] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in \\'self-driving\\' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[476]\\nAccording to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[477][478] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[479] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[479][480][481] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[482] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update.[483] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver\\'s supervision.\"[484]\\nA safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[485] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[486] Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[487]\\n\\nSoftware hacking\\nIn August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car\\'s entertainment system.[488] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[489] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[490]\\nIn September 2016, researchers at Tencent\\'s Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle\\'s web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[491] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[492] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[493]\\nIn January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[494][495] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[496]\\nIn June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their keys to a vehicle.[497]\\n\\nPhantom braking\\nIn February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker\\'s removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[498] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[499]\\nIn May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[500] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[501] Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[502]\\n\\nDriving range performance\\nTesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled.

In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers\\' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[527] The investors wrote that \"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.\"[528] Tesla\\'s directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[529] Elon Musk\\'s brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[530] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[528] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[528] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members;[531] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[532] Ellison stepped down in August 2022.[533] Former Tesla CTO J. B. Straubel who left the company in 2019, was elected to the board in 2023.[534]\\nAnother criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience.[535] The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at Toyota Australia from 1989 to 1996.[536]\\nOther previous board members include businessman Steve Westly; Daimler executive Herbert Kohler;[274] CEO and Chairman of Johnson Publishing Company Linda Johnson Rice;[537] and United Nations Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investments Hiromichi Mizuno.[538][539]\\nAs of May 2023[update], the board members are:[540]\\n\\n\\n\\nJoined\\n\\nName\\n\\nTitles\\n\\nIndependent\\n\\n\\n2014[541]\\n\\nRobyn Denholm\\n\\nChair (since November 2018); former CFO and Head of Strategy at Telstra[536]\\n\\nYes\\n\\n\\n2004[16]\\n\\nElon Musk\\n\\nCEO, product architect, former chairman; founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX\\n\\nNo\\n\\n\\n2004[542]\\n\\nKimbal Musk\\n\\nSpaceX board member[543]\\n\\nNo\\n\\n\\n2007[544]\\n\\nIra Ehrenpreis\\n\\nGeneral Partner at Technology Partners[537]\\n\\nDisputed[527]\\n\\n\\n2017[537]\\n\\nJames Murdoch\\n\\nFormer CEO of 21st Century Fox[537]\\n\\nYes\\n\\n\\n2018[529]\\n\\nKathleen Wilson-Thompson\\n\\nGlobal head of Human Resources of Walgreens Boots Alliance[529]\\n\\nYes\\n\\n\\n2022[545]\\n\\nJoe Gebbia\\n\\nCo-founder, board member and advisor of Airbnb[546]\\n\\nYes\\n\\n\\n2023[534]\\n\\nJ.

For passenger electric vehicles, see electric car. For the batteries themselves, see Electric vehicle battery.\\n\\n\\nThe Nissan Leaf (left) and the Tesla Model S (right) were the world\\'s all-time top-selling all-electric cars in 2018.\\nCharging Peugeot e208 at a high power charging station\\nCharging point\\nA battery electric vehicle (BEV), pure electric vehicle, only-electric vehicle, fully electric vehicle or all-electric vehicle is a type of electric vehicle (EV) that uses energy exclusively from an on-board battery. This definition excludes hybrid electric vehicles. BEVs use electric motors and motor controllers instead of internal combustion engines (ICEs) for propulsion. They derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine, fuel cell, or fuel tank. BEVs include – but are not limited to[1][2]  – motorcycles, bicycles, scooters, skateboards, railcars, watercraft, forklifts, buses, trucks, and cars.\\nIn 2016, there were 210 million electric bikes worldwide used daily.[3] Cumulative global sales of highway-capable light-duty pure electric car vehicles passed the one million unit milestone in September 2016.[4] As of October\\xa02020[update], the world\\'s top selling all-electric car in history is the Tesla Model 3, with an estimated 645,000 sales,[5] followed by the Nissan Leaf with over 500,000 sales as of September\\xa02020[update].[6]\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nMain article: History of the electric vehicle\\nDuring the 1880s, Gustave Trouvé, Thomas Parker and Andreas Flocken built experimental electric cars, but the first practical battery electric vehicles appeared during the 1890s.[7] Battery vehicle milk floats expanded in 1931, and by 1967, gave Britain the largest electric vehicle fleet in the world.[citation needed]\\n\\nTerminology[edit]\\nSee also: Hybrid electric vehicle, Plug-in hybrid, and Plug-in electric vehicle\\nHybrid electric vehicles use both electric motors and internal combustion engines, and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles.[8]\\nHybrid electric vehicles whose batteries can be charged externally are called plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and run as BEVs during their charge-depleting mode. PHEVs with a series powertrain are also called range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs), such as the Chevrolet Volt and Fisker Karma.\\nPlug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are a subcategory of electric vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs).\\nThe electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (aka all-combustion vehicles) belong to one of the two categories.[8][9]\\nIn China, plug-in electric vehicles, together with hybrid electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).[10] However, in the United States, neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) are battery electric vehicles that are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits no higher than 45 miles per hour (72\\xa0km/h), are usually built to have a top speed of 30 miles per hour (48\\xa0km/h), and have a maximum loaded weight of 3,000 pounds (1,400\\xa0kg).[11]\\n\\nVehicles by type[edit]\\nThe concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged batteries on board vehicles for propulsion. Battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the higher oil prices and the advancement of new battery technology (lithium-ion) that have higher power and energy density (i.e., greater possible acceleration and more range with fewer batteries).[12] Compared to older battery types such as lead-acid batteries. Lithium-ion batteries for example now have an energy density of 0.9–2.63 MJ/L whereas lead-acid batteries had an energy density of 0.36 MJ/L (so 2.5 to 7.3x higher). There is still a long way to go if comparing it to petroleum-based fuels and biofuels, however (gasoline having an energy density of 34.2 MJ/L -38x to 12.92x higher- and ethanol having an energy of 24 MJ/L -26x to 9.12x higher-). This is partially offset by higher conversion efficiency of electric motors – BEVs travel roughly 3x further than similar-size internal combustion vehicles per MJ of stored energy.\\nBEVs include automobiles, light trucks, and neighborhood electric vehicles.\\n\\nRail[edit]\\nBattery electric railcars:Main article: Battery electric multiple unit\\nEV-E301 battery electric multiple unit on the Karasuyama Line, Japan\\nBattery electric trains in the form of BEMUs (battery electric multiple units) are operated commercially in Japan. They are charged via pantographs, either when driving on electrified railway lines or during stops at specially equipped train stations. They use battery power for propulsion when driving on railway lines that are not electrified, and have successfully replaced diesel multiple units on some such lines.\\nOther countries have also tested or ordered such vehicles.\\n\\nLocomotives:Main article: Battery-electric locomotive\\nElectric rail trolley: Main article: Cater MetroTrolley\\nBus[edit]\\nThis article may contain excessive or irrelevant examples. Please help improve the article by adding descriptive text and removing less pertinent examples. (August 2024)\\nMain article: Battery electric bus\\nBYD K9A in Guangzhou\\nChattanooga, Tennessee, operates nine zero-fare electric buses, which have been in operation since 1992 and have carried 11.3 million passengers and covered a distance of 3,100,000 kilometres (1,900,000\\xa0mi). They were made locally by Advanced Vehicle Systems. Two of these buses were used for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.[13][14]\\nBeginning in the summer of 2000, Hong Kong Airport began operating a 16-passenger Mitsubishi Rosa electric shuttle bus, and in the fall of 2000, New York City began testing a 66-passenger battery-powered school bus, an all-electric version of the Blue Bird TC/2000.[15] A similar bus was operated in Napa Valley, California, for 14 months ending in April 2004.[16]\\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympics used a fleet of 50 electric buses, which have a range of 130\\xa0km (81\\xa0mi) with the air conditioning on. They use lithium-ion batteries, and consume about 1\\xa0kW⋅h/mi (0.62\\xa0kW⋅h/km; 2.2\\xa0MJ/km). The buses were designed by the Beijing Institute of Technology and built by the Jinghua Coach.[17] The batteries are replaced with fully charged ones at the recharging station to allow 24-hour operation of the buses.[18]\\nIn France, the electric bus phenomenon is in development, but some buses are already operating in numerous cities.[19] PVI, a medium-sized company located in the Paris region, is one of the leaders of the market with its brand Gepebus (offering Oreos 2X and Oreos 4X).[20]\\nIn the United States, the first battery-electric, fast-charge bus has been in operation in Pomona, California, since September 2010 at Foothill Transit. The Proterra EcoRide BE35 uses lithium-titanate batteries and is able to fast-charge in less than 10 minutes.[21]\\nIn 2012, heavy-duty trucks and buses contributed 7% of global warming emissions in California.[22]\\nIn 2014, the first production model all-electric school bus was delivered to the Kings Canyon Unified School District in California\\'s San Joaquin Valley. The bus was one of four the district ordered. This battery-electric school bus, which has four sodium nickel batteries, is the first modern electric school bus approved for student transportation by any state.[23]\\nIn 2016, including the light heavy-duty vehicles, there were roughly 1.5 million heavy-duty vehicles in California.[22]\\n\\nThe first all-electric school bus in the state of California pausing outside the California capitol building in Sacramento\\nThe same technology is used to power the Mountain View Community Shuttles. This technology was supported by the California Energy Commission, and the shuttle program is being supported by Google.[24]\\n\\nThunder Sky[edit]\\nThunder Sky (based in Hong Kong) builds lithium-ion batteries used in submarines and has three models of electric buses, the 10/21 passenger EV-6700 with a range of 280\\xa0km (170\\xa0mi) under 20 mins quick-charge, the EV-2009 city buses, and the 43 passenger EV-2008 highway bus, which has a range of 300\\xa0km (190\\xa0mi) under quick-charge (20 mins to 80 percent), and 350\\xa0km (220\\xa0mi) under full charge (25 mins). The buses will also be built in the United States and Finland.[25]\\n\\nFree Tindo[edit]\\nTindo is an all-electric bus from Adelaide, Australia. The Tindo (aboriginal word for sun) is made by Designline International[26] in New Zealand and gets its electricity from a solar PV system on Adelaide\\'s central bus station. Rides are zero-fare as part of Adelaide\\'s public transport system.[27]\\n\\nFirst Fast-Charge, Battery-Electric Transit Bus[edit]\\nProterra\\'s EcoRide BE35 transit bus, called the Ecoliner by Foothill Transit in West Covina, California, is a heavy-duty, fast charge, battery-electric bus. Proterra\\'s ProDrive drive-system uses a UQM motor and regenerative braking that captures 90 percent of the available energy and returns it to the TerraVolt energy storage system, which in turn increases the total distance the bus can drive by 31–35 percent. It can travel 30–40 miles (48–64\\xa0km) on a single charge, is up to 600 percent more fuel-efficient than a typical diesel or CNG bus, and produces 44 percent less carbon than CNG.[28] Proterra buses have had several problems, most notably in Philadelphia where the entire fleet was removed from service.[29]\\n\\nTrucks[edit]\\nMain article: Electric truck\\nFor most of the 20th century, the majority of the world\\'s battery electric road vehicles were British milk floats.[30] The 21st century saw the massive development of BYD electric trucks.[31]\\n\\nVans[edit]\\nMain article: Electric truck §\\xa0Cargo vans\\nIn March 2012, Smith Electric Vehicles announced the release of the Newton Step-Van, an all-electric, zero-emission vehicle built on the versatile Newton platform that features a walk-in body produced by Indiana-based Utilimaster.[32]\\nBYD supplies DHL with electric distribution fleet of commercial BYD T3.[33]\\n\\nCars[edit]\\nSee also: Electric car use by country\\nAlthough electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed, the lower specific energy of production batteries available in 2015 compared with carbon-based fuels means that electric cars need batteries that are a fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give a relatively low range between charges. Recharging can also take significant lengths of time. For journeys within a single battery charge, rather than long journeys, electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight.\\nElectric cars can significantly reduce city pollution by having zero emissions.[34][35][36] Vehicle greenhouse gas savings depend on how the electricity is generated.[37][38]\\nElectric cars are having a major impact in the auto industry[39][40] given advantages in city pollution, less dependence on oil and combustion, and scarcity and expected rise in gasoline prices.[41][42][43] World governments are pledging billions to fund development of electric vehicles and their components.[44][45]\\nFormula E is a fully electric international single-seater championship. The series was conceived in 2012, and the inaugural championship started in Beijing on 13 September 2014. The series is sanctioned by the FIA. Alejandro Agag is the current CEO of Formula E.[46][47]\\n\\nThe Formula E championship is currently contested by ten teams with two drivers each (after the withdrawal of Team Trulli, there are temporarily only nine teams competing). Racing generally takes place on temporary city-center street circuits which are approximately 2 to 3.4 kilometres (1.2 to 2.1\\xa0mi) long. Currently, only the Mexico City ePrix takes place on a road course, a modified version of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.[citation needed]Electric vehicles for disabled people in Årdalstangen, Norway\\nSpecial-purpose vehicles[edit]\\nSee also: Electrathon\\nSpecial-purpose vehicles come in a wide range of types, ranging from relatively common ones such as golf carts, things like electric golf trolleys, milk floats, all-terrain vehicles, neighborhood electric vehicles, and a wide range of other devices. Certain manufacturers specialize in electric-powered \"in plant\" work machines.\\n\\nMotorcycles, scooters and rickshaws[edit]\\nMain article: Electric motorcycles and scooters\\nThree-wheeled vehicles include electric rickshaws, a powered variant of the cycle rickshaw. The large-scale adoption of electric two-wheelers can reduce traffic noise and road congestion but may necessitate adaptations of the existing urban infrastructure and safety regulations.[48]\\nAther Energy from India has launched their BLDC motor powered Ather 450 electric scooter with Lithium Ion batteries in 2018.[49][50] Also from India, AVERA [51] – a new and renewable energy company is going to launch two models of electric scooters[52] at the end of 2018, with Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery technology.[53][needs update]\\n\\nBicycles[edit]\\nA person riding an electric bike in Tokyo\\nPedelecs from the Call a Bike bicycle hire scheme in Berlin\\nMain article: Electric bicycles\\nIndia is the world’s biggest market for bicycles at 22 million units per year. By 2024, electric two-wheelers will be a $2 billion market with over 3 million units being sold in India.[54]\\nThe Indian government is launching schemes and incentives to promote the adoption of electric vehicles in the country, and is aiming to be a manufacturing hub for electric vehicles within the next five years.[55][56]\\nChina has experienced an explosive growth of sales of non-assisted e-bikes including the scooter type, with annual sales jumping from 56,000 units in 1998 to over 21\\xa0million in 2008,[57] and reaching an estimated 120\\xa0million e-bikes on the road in early 2010. China is the world\\'s leading manufacturer of e-bikes, with 22.2 million units produced in 2009.\\n\\nPersonal transporters[edit]\\nAn increasing variety of personal transporters are being manufactured, including the one-wheeled self-balancing unicycles, self-balancing scooters, electric kick scooters, and electric skateboards.\\n\\nBoats[edit]\\nMain article: Electric boat\\nSeveral battery electric ships operate throughout the world, some for business. Electric ferries are being operated and constructed.[58]\\n\\nTechnology[edit]\\n\\nFuel use in vehicle designs\\n\\n\\nVehicle type\\nFuel used\\n\\n\\nCombustion-only vehicle(ICE)\\nExclusively uses petroleum or other fuel.\\n\\n\\nMicro hybrid electric vehicle(μHEV)\\nExclusively uses petroleum or other fuel,but can shut off engine to consume less.\\n\\n\\nMild hybrid electric vehicle(MHEV, BAHV)\\nExclusively uses petroleum or other fuel,but has electric battery to consume less.\\n\\n\\nPlug-in hybrid vehicle(PHEV)\\nUses mixture of petroleum or other fueland electricity from power grid.\\n\\n\\nAll-electric vehicle (BEV, AEV)\\nExclusively uses electricity from power grid.\\n\\n\\nFuel cell vehicle(FCV, FCEV)\\nExclusively uses hydrogen or other fuelto generate electricity.\\n\\n\\nvte\\n\\nMotor controllers[edit]\\nMain article: Motor controller\\nThe motor controller receives a signal from potentiometers linked to the accelerator pedal, and it uses this signal to determine how much electric power is needed.[59] This DC power is supplied by the battery pack, and the controller regulates the power to the motor, supplying either variable pulse width DC or variable frequency variable amplitude AC, depending on the motor type. The controller also handles regenerative braking, whereby electrical power is gathered as the vehicle slows down and this power recharges the battery.[59] In addition to power and motor management, the controller performs various safety checks such as anomaly detection, functional safety tests and failure diagnostics.[60]\\n\\nBattery pack[edit]\\n Learning curve of lithium-ion batteries: the price of batteries declined by 97% in three decades.[61][62]\\nMain article: Electric battery\\nMost electric vehicles today use an electric battery, consisting of electrochemical cells with external connections in order to provide power to the vehicle.[63]\\nBattery technology for EVs has developed from early lead-acid batteries used in the late 19th century to the 2010s, to lithium-ion batteries which are found in most EVs today.[60] The overall battery is referred to as a battery pack, which is a group of multiple battery modules and cells. For example, the Tesla Model S battery pack has up to 7,104 cells, split into 16 modules with 6 groups of 74 cells in each. Each cell has a nominal voltage of 3–4 volts, depending on its chemical composition.\\n\\nMotors[edit]\\nMain article: Traction motor\\nElectric cars have traditionally used series wound DC motors, a form of brushed DC electric motor. Separately excited and permanent magnet are just two of the types of DC motors available. More recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of AC motor types, as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out. These are usually induction motors or brushless AC electric motors which use permanent magnets. There are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes and/or lower cost including the brushless DC electric motor.\\nOnce electric power is supplied to the motor (from the controller), the magnetic field interaction inside the motor will turn the drive shaft and ultimately the vehicle\\'s wheels.[59]\\n\\nEconomy[edit]\\nEV battery storage is a key element for the global energy transition which is dependent on more electricity storage right now. As energy availability is the most important factor for the vitality of an economy the mobile storage infrastructure of EV batteries can be seen as one of the most meaningful infrastructure projects facilitating the energy transition to a fully sustainable economy based on renewables. A meta-study graphically showing the importance of electricity storage depicts the technology in context.[64]\\n\\nEnvironmental impact[edit]\\nMain article: Health and environmental effects of battery electric cars\\nPower generation[edit]\\nElectric vehicles produce no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in operation, but the electricity used to power them may do so in its generation.[65] The two factors driving the emissions of battery electric vehicles are the carbon intensity of the electricity used to recharge the Electric Vehicle (commonly expressed in grams of CO2 per kWh) and the consumption of the specific vehicle (in kilometers/kWh).\\nThe carbon intensity of electricity varies depending on the source of electricity where it is consumed. A country with a high share of renewable energy in its electricity mix will have a low C.I. In the European Union, in 2013, the carbon intensity had a strong geographic variability but in most of the member states, electric vehicles were \"greener\" than conventional ones. On average, electric cars saved 50–60% of CO2 emissions compared to diesel and gasoline fuelled engines.[citation needed]\\nMoreover, the de-carbonisation process is constantly reducing the GHG emissions due to the use of electric vehicles. In the European Union, on average, between 2009 and 2013 there was a reduction in the electricity carbon intensity of 17%.[66] In a life-cycle assessment perspective, considering the GHG necessary to build the battery and its end-of-life, the GHG savings are 10–13% lower.[67]\\nThe open source VencoPy model framework can be used to study the interactions between vehicles, owners, and the electricity system at large.[68]\\n\\nVehicle construction[edit]\\nGHGs are also emitted when the electric vehicle is being manufactured. The lithium-ion batteries used in the vehicle take more materials and energy to produce because of the extraction process of the lithium and cobalt essential to the battery.[69] This means the bigger the electric vehicle, the more carbon dioxide emitted. The same size-to-emission relationship applies to manufacturing of all products.\\nThe mines that are used to produce the lithium and cobalt used in the battery are also creating problems for the environment, as fish are dying up to 240\\xa0km (150\\xa0mi) downstream from mining operations due to chemical leaks and the chemicals also leak into the water sources the people that live near the mines use, creating health problems for the animals and people that live nearby.[70]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\n\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Battery-powered vehicles.\\n\\n\\nAll-electric range\\nAutomotive battery\\nBattery balancing\\nCapa vehicle\\nElectric Drive Transportation Association (EDTA)\\nElectric vehicle battery\\nElectric vehicle warning sounds\\nGlobal Electric Motorcars\\nGovernment incentives for plug-in electric vehicles\\nGreenpower\\nHydrogen vehicle\\nList of battery electric vehicles\\nList of electric vehicle battery manufacturers\\nList of production battery electric vehicles\\nMiles per gallon gasoline equivalent\\nPatent encumbrance of large automotive NiMH batteries\\nPhase-out of fossil fuel vehicles\\nRoad-powered electric vehicle\\nShort-commute vehicles\\nSupercapacitor\\nThink Global\\nTokyo Electric Power Company\\nWireless charging\\nPersonal electric vehicle (PEV)\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ \"FAQ\".

His other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company that operates the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and his role in the founding of the Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. Musk is the wealthiest individual in the world; as of November\\xa02024[update], Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$323\\xa0billion.[2]\\nA member of the wealthy South African Musk family, Musk was born in Pretoria and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen\\'s University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor\\'s degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but never enrolled in classes, and with his brother Kimbal co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In 2002, Musk acquired US citizenship, and that October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5\\xa0billion. Using $100\\xa0million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. \\nIn 2004, Musk was an early investor in electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), providing most of the initial financing and assuming the position of the company\\'s chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44\\xa0billion, merged the company into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.\\nMusk\\'s actions and expressed views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, promoting right-wing conspiracy theories, and endorsing an antisemitic trope; he has since apologized for the latter. His ownership of Twitter has been controversial because of the layoffs of large numbers of employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation posts on the website, and changes to website features, including verification. \\nIn early 2024, Musk became active in American politics as a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump, becoming Trump\\'s second-largest individual donor in October 2024. In November 2024, Trump announced that he had chosen Musk along with Vivek Ramaswamy to co-lead Trump\\'s planned Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) advisory board which will make recommendations on improving government efficiency through measures such as slashing \"excess regulations\" and cutting \"wasteful expenditures\".\\n\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nChildhood and family\\nSee also: Family of Elon Musk\\nElon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa\\'s administrative capital.[3][4] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[5][6] His mother, Maye (née\\xa0Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[7][8][9] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[10][11][12][13] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[9][14] Elon has four paternal half-siblings.[15][16][17]\\nThe family was wealthy during Elon\\'s youth.[13] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[13] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines\".[18][19] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father\\'s dislike of apartheid.[3]\\nElon\\'s maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane; Haldeman died when Elon was still a toddler.[16][20][21][22] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies\" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[23]\\nAfter his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[5][10] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[24] Elon attended Bryanston High School.[25] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely by the boy and his friends, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[26] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital, saying, \"I had to stand for an hour as he yelled at me and called me an idiot and told me that I was just worthless.\"[26] Errol denied berating Elon but claimed, \"The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\".[27] After the incident, Elon was enrolled in private school.[26][27]\\nElon was an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy.[12][28] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[29] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[30][31]\\n\\nEducation\\nMusk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa.\\nMusk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[32] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[33] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa\\'s mandatory military service,[34][35] which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime,[3] and to ease his path to immigration to the United States.[36] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[37]\\nMusk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[38] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[39] In 1990, he entered Queen\\'s University in Kingston, Ontario.[40][41] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied until 1995.[42] Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university\\'s Wharton School.[43][44][45][46][47][48] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[49]\\nIn 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[50][51] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[46][43][52] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[53][34] The Washington Post reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford.[52] In response, Musk claimed he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B.  According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk claimed he was on a student visa at the time.[54]\\n\\nBusiness career\\nZip2\\nMain article: Zip2\\nExternal videos Musk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at University of Southern California on YouTube\\nIn 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed Zip2.[55][56] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[57] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[58] with Musk coding the website every night.[58] Musk and his brother\\'s immigration statuses during this period were described by Musk as a \"gray area\", although Kimbal maintained they were working as illegal immigrants.[59][60] A Washington Post exposé from October 2024 reported Musk worked illegally while building the company, citing an email from Musk submitted as evidence during a 2005 defamation trial and the funding agreement from venture capital firm Mohr Davidow Ventures.[52]\\nEventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[49] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[61] however, Musk\\'s attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[62] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307\\xa0million in cash in February 1999,[63][64] and Musk received $22\\xa0million for his 7-percent share.[65]\\n\\nX.com and PayPal\\nMain articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia\\nIn March 1999,[66] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[67] X.com was one of the first online banks that was federally insured, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[68]\\nMusk\\'s friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived from it, such as \"e@x.com\".[66] Although Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[69]\\nIn 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[58][69][70] as the latter\\'s money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com\\'s service.[71] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft- over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company\\'s employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[72] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[73][a] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[75][76]\\nIn 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5\\xa0billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal\\'s largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received $176\\xa0million.[77][78] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[79][80] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[81]\\n\\nSpaceX\\nMain article: SpaceX\\nThen-NASA Administrator Charles Bolden congratulating Musk by the SpaceX Dragon following its 2012 mission\\nIn early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[82] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim Cantrell, Adeo Ressi, and future NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin[83] to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[84] and the group returned to the United States without an agreement to purchase Russian launch services. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8\\xa0million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[84] With $100\\xa0million of his own money,[85] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company\\'s CEO and chief engineer.[86][87]\\nSpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[88] Although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA, now led by Michael D. Griffin as Administrator.[89][90] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[88] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[91] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6\\xa0billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[92] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[93]\\n\\nMusk examining F9R Dev1 debris in 2014\\nWorking towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[94] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[95] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk\\'s personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[96][97] Since 2019,[98] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[99] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[100] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[101]\\n\\nStarlink\\nMain article: Starlink\\nSee also: Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War\\nThis section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies.

A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[103] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10\\xa0billion.[104][b] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[107][108][109]\\nDuring the March 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[110] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80\\xa0million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[111] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400\\xa0million.[112][113][114] At the same time, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself \"a free speech absolutist\".[115][116]\\nIn September 2023, Ukraine asked for the activation of Starlink satellites over Crimea to attack Russian naval vessels located at the port Sevastopol; Musk denied the request, citing concerns that Russia would respond with a nuclear attack.[117][118][119]\\n\\nTesla\\nMain article: Tesla, Inc.\\nMusk next to a Tesla Model S, 2011\\nTesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men played active roles in the company\\'s early development prior to Musk\\'s involvement.[120] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35\\xa0million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla\\'s board of directors as chairman.[121][122] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[123]\\nFollowing a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[124][page\\xa0needed][125] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[126] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[127][128] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[129] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[130]\\n\\nMusk before a Model X at the 2014 Tesla Inc. annual shareholder meeting\\nTesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[131] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model\\xa0S sedan in 2012.[132] A crossover, the Model X was launched in 2015.[133] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[134] In 2020, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1\\xa0million units globally.[135][136] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020, and in December 2023, became the best-selling vehicle of any type,[137] as well as the all-time best-selling electric car.[138] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019,[139] and delivered in November 2023.[140] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[141]\\nSince its initial public offering in 2010,[142] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[143][144] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[145][146] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1\\xa0trillion, the sixth company in US history to do so.[147] In November 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter to sell some of his Tesla stock.[148] After more than 3.5\\xa0million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9\\xa0billion of Tesla stock within a week,[148] and a total of $16.4\\xa0billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[149] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Musk and his brother Kimbal were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for possible insider trading related to the sale.[150] In 2022, Musk unveiled Optimus, a robot being developed by Tesla.[151] In June 2023, Musk met with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in New York City, stating he was interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[152]\\n\\nSEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets\\nIn 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[153][c] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[153][157][158] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC\\'s allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20\\xa0million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[159] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet,[160] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[161] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[162][163]\\nIn 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half\\xa0a\\xa0million cars that year.[164] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details,[165] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance.[166] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[167][168] Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla\\'s solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[169]\\n\\nSolarCity and Tesla Energy\\nMain articles: SolarCity and Tesla Energy\\nSolarCity solar-panel installation vans in 2009\\nMusk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[170] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[171] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[172] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[173][174]\\nTesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal\\'s announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla\\'s stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[175] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla\\'s directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[176][177] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[178][179] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk\\'s favor.[180]\\n\\nNeuralink\\nMain article: Neuralink\\nMusk discussing a Neuralink device during a live demonstration in 2020\\nIn 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100\\xa0million.[181][182] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[182][183] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer\\'s disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[184]\\nIn 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[181] In an October 2019 paper that detailed some of Neuralink\\'s research,[185] Musk was listed as the sole author, which rankled Neuralink researchers.[186] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[187][188][189] with MIT Technology Review describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[187] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[184] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[190]\\nNeuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis\\' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company\\'s animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink\\'s animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[191] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[192] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate human trials, and it plans to conduct a six-year study.[193]\\n\\nThe Boring Company\\nMain article: The Boring Company\\nMusk during the 2018 inauguration of the Boring Test Tunnel in Hawthorne, California\\nIn 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240\\xa0km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[194][195] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1\\xa0m) wide, 50-foot (15\\xa0m) long, and 15-foot (4.6\\xa0m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX\\'s offices, as that required no permits.[196] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2\\xa0km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[197]\\nTwo tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[198][199] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[200] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[201]\\n\\nTwitter / X\\nFurther information: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and Twitter under Elon Musk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAvatar of Elon Musk\\n\\n\\nElon Musk @elonmusk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI made an offerhttps://sec.gov/Archives/edgar...\\n\\n\\nApril 14, 2022[202]\\n\\n\\n\\nMusk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[203] and had questioned the platform\\'s commitment to freedom of speech.[204][205] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[206] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[207] making him the largest shareholder.[208][d] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company\\'s 2013 initial public offering.[210] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter\\'s board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[211][212] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43\\xa0billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter\\'s stock at $54.20 per share.[208][213] In response, Twitter\\'s board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[214] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44\\xa0billion.[215] This included about $12.5\\xa0billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21\\xa0billion in equity financing.[216][217]\\nTesla\\'s stock market value sank by over $100\\xa0billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[218][219] He subsequently tweeted to his 86 million followers criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde\\'s policies, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[220] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter\\'s daily active users were spam accounts.[221] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[222] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter\\'s board of directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[223] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[224] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[225] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[226]\\nImmediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[226][227] Musk became the CEO instead.[228] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a \"blue check\",[229][230][231] and laid off a significant portion of the company\\'s staff.[232][233] Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like The Babylon Bee.[234][235] The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists;[236] hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[237][238]\\nIn December 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter\\'s moderation of Hunter Biden\\'s laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[239] Comments on these internal documents by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Michael Shellenberger and others were posted on Twitter as the Twitter Files. Musk and many Republicans alleged the documents showed the FBI had engaged in government censorship by ordering Twitter to suppress a New York Post story about the laptop. Upon review of the documents, Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation, and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing.[240][241] The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.[242]\\nIn late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that a majority of users wanted him to do so.[243][244] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[245]\\nOn November 20, 2023, in a U.S. District Court in Texas, X filed a lawsuit stating that Media Matters \"manipulated\" the X platform, in that it used accounts that followed major brands, and \"resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing\" the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts.[246]\\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in August 2024 that the $13 billion Musk borrowed to buy Twitter \"is now considered the worst deal in merger finance that banks have participated in since the 2008 to \\'09 financial crisis\", adding that \"the allure of banking Elon Musk, providing capital for him to buy a company, not only would reward them handsomely if things went according to plan\" but \"you can certainly say things have not gone according to plan\".[247] The Washington Post reported in September 2024 that the company had lost $24 billion in equity value, \"a vaporization of wealth that has little parallel outside the realm of economic or industry-specific crashes, or devastating corporate scandals\".[248] Two years after the acquisition, Fidelity Investments estimated the value of its stake in X that implied the company had lost 79% of its value.[249]\\n\\nLeadership style\\nMusk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012\\nMusk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[250] The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[251] Musk does not make formal business plans.[251] He has forced employees to adopt the company\\'s own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors\\' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX\\'s rocket,[252] vertical integration (as of 2018) has caused many usability problems for Tesla\\'s internal corporate software.[250][needs update]\\nMusk\\'s handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[253][254][255] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes 80 hours per week.[256] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[257][255] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[255] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla\\'s workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[258] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[259] He laid off more than 10 percent of the Tesla workforce in early 2024.\\nMusk\\'s leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[250] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding\".[255][260] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[261] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some[quantify] employees resigning in 2017 in consequence.[262]\\n\\nOther activities\\nMusk Foundation\\nMusk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[263][264] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[265]\\nAs of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal\\'s nonprofit Big Green.[266] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25\\xa0million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk\\'s OpenAI,[267] which was a nonprofit at the time.[268] The Foundation also allocated $100 million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas.[269]\\nIn 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[270] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100\\xa0million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[271]\\nVox said in February 2021, \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[267] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[266] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7\\xa0billion of Tesla\\'s shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[272] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation\\'s assets up to $9.4\\xa0billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160\\xa0million to nonprofits that year.[273] Reporting by The New York Times found that in 2022, the Musk Foundation gave away $230 million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status, and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundation\\'s funds went to causes connected to Musk, his family, or his businesses.[274]\\n\\nHyperloop\\nMain articles: Hyperloop and Hyperloop pod competition\\nA tube part of the 2017 Hyperloop pod competition sponsored by SpaceX\\nIn August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vacuum tube train and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[275] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[276] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[277] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6\\xa0billion.[278] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[279] Biographer Ashlee Vance noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[280]\\nIn 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[281] In July 2017, Musk said that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore.[282] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website in 2021.[283] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[284]\\nMobility experts have criticized the Hyperloop concept for potential safety issues, planning complexity, low passenger capacity, and extremely high costs.[285][286] Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard, said, \"It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision.\"[287]\\n\\nOpenAI and xAI\\nFurther information: OpenAI and xAI (company)\\nIn December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[288] A particular focus of the company was to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[24] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[289] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI\\'s funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[290]\\nIn 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[291] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as ChatGPT (producing human-like text),[292] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[293]\\nOn July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[294] Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[295]\\nOn February 29, 2024, Musk sued OpenAI, its Chief Executive Sam Altman, and its President Greg Brockman. He accused the company of violating its founding agreement by prioritizing profits over AI safety.[296]\\n\\nTham Luang cave rescue and defamation case\\nFurther information: Tham Luang cave rescue\\nIn July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[297] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk\\'s involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[298] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[299][300] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn\\'t practical for the rescue mission.[297][301] In March 2019, Musk was one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[302]\\nSoon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[303] He then deleted the tweets,[303] apologized,[304] and deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[305] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[306][307]\\nIn September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit seeking $190\\xa0million in damages.[308][309][310] In his defense, Musk argued that, \"\\'pedo guy\\' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up\\xa0... synonymous with \\'creepy old man\\' and is used to insult a person\\'s appearance and demeanor.\"[32] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. In December 2019, the jury ruled that Musk was not liable.[311][312]\\n\\n2018 cannabis incident\\nIn September 2018, Musk was interviewed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he appeared to smoke a joint.[313] In 2022, Musk said that he and other SpaceX employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[314] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[315]\\n\\nMusic\\nIn March 2019, Musk, through his own label Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[316][317] The track refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event.[318] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don\\'t Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[319] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[320] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[319]\\n\\nPrivate jet\\nMain articles: ElonJet and 2022 Twitter suspensions\\nMusk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[321][322] His heavy use of the jets—which flew over 150,000 miles in 2018 alone—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[321][323] Musk\\'s flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. After Musk said that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed,[324][325][326] Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O\\'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[327] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[328] Police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[329] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists\\' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[330]\\n\\nCompany towns\\nMain articles: Boca Chica Village, Texas and Snailbrook, Texas\\nAfter 2020, thousands of acres of land just outside Austin, Texas, were acquired by Musk and his companies with a total value of $2.5 billion.[331][332] The project to build the company town named Snailbrook in Bastrop County, Texas began in 2021 according to reports by The Wall Street Journal.[333] Musk\\'s then-girlfriend Grimes and Kanye West were involved in the planning.[333] The name \"Snailbrook\" alludes to The Boring Company\\'s stated goal of building a machine that can bore tunnels faster than a snail can move.[333] In 2023 the town had a reported population of 12 people.[334] There are plans to establish a school and a university there.[331]\\n\\nWealth\\nMain article: Wealth of Elon Musk\\nMusk was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2\\xa0billion.[335]\\n\\nPersonal actions, views, and social media usage\\n\\n\\nThis article is part of a series onConservatismin the United States\\nSchools\\nCompassionate\\nFiscal\\nFusion\\nLiberal\\nLibertarian\\nModerate\\nMovement\\nNeo-\\nPaleo-\\nPostliberal\\nPopulist\\nProgressive\\nSocial\\nStraussian\\nTraditionalist\\n\\n\\nPrinciples\\nAmerican exceptionalism\\nAmerican nationalism\\nAnti-communism\\nChristian nationalism\\nCivil religion\\nClassical liberalism\\nCommunitarianism\\nConstitutionalism\\nCulture of life\\nPro-life\\nFamilialism\\nFamily values\\nFederalism\\nStates\\' rights\\nGender essentialism\\nComplementarianism\\nJudeo-Christian values\\nIndividualism\\nLaw and order\\nLimited government\\nMeritocracy\\nNatural aristocracy\\nMilitarism\\nPeace through strength\\nMoral absolutism\\nNatural law\\nOrdered liberty\\nPatriotism\\nProperty rights\\nRepublicanism\\nRight to bear arms\\nRule of law\\nSupply-side economics\\nTradition\\n\\n\\nHistory\\nLoyalists\\nSouthern chivalry\\nSolid South\\nNew Humanism\\nSouthern Agrarians\\nOld Right\\nConservative Manifesto\\nConservative coalition\\nAmerica First Committee\\nMcCarthyism\\nGoldwater campaign\\nNew Right\\nReagan era\\nReagan Doctrine\\nReaganomics\\nNeo- vs. paleoconservatism\\nRedeemers\\nRepublican Revolution\\nTea Party movement\\nTrump era\\nFirst term\\nSecond term\\n\\n\\nIntellectuals\\nAdams\\nAnton\\nBabbitt\\nBacevich\\nBell\\nBellow\\nBerger\\nBloom\\nBoorstin\\nBradford\\nBuckley\\nBurgess\\nBurnham\\nCalhoun\\nCarl\\nChambers\\nConquest\\nDeneen\\nEastman\\nEliot\\nFrancis\\nGenovese\\nGottfried\\nHanson\\nHazony\\nHimmelfarb\\nHoppe\\nHurston\\nJaffa\\nKendall\\nKimball\\nKirk\\nKirkpatrick\\nKreeft\\nKristol\\nKuehnelt-Leddihn\\nLasch\\nLind\\nLovecraft\\nLoury\\nLukacs\\nMansfield\\nMencken\\nMeyer\\nMolnar\\nMurray\\nNisbet\\nPangle\\nRansom\\nRieff\\nSantayana\\nSchaeffer\\nSowell\\nStrauss\\nViereck\\nVoegelin\\nWeaver\\nWeyl\\nWolfe\\n\\n\\nPoliticians\\nAdams (John)\\nAdams (John Quincy)\\nBolton\\nBuchanan\\nBush (George H.

Heinlein, for inspiring many of his personal views and business ventures, including SpaceX, Grok, and his libertarian inclinations.[336][337] Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[338] Musk has been an active user and has over 163 million followers as of November\\xa02023[update].[339] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[340] Musk\\'s statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[341][342] and comparing Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[343]\\nThe New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[344] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia\\'s apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[345] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[346][347]\\n\\nFinance\\nMusk said that the US government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[348][349] The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.[350]\\nTesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.[351] As of February 2024, Tesla has made $9 billion from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits.[352] Tax credits offered in California, at the United States federal level, and by other governments have enabled Tesla\\'s battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive in comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles and facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles.[353]\\nMusk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[354][355] Wired magazine speculated that Musk\\'s opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[356] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[357][358]\\nIn December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[359] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[360]\\n\\nTechnology\\nMusk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[361] Given the influence of Musk\\'s tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[362] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[363] Musk\\'s social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla\\'s 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk\\'s social media behavior, that it bought $1.5\\xa0billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[364] Tesla\\'s announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[365][366]\\nDespite The Boring Company\\'s involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[367][368][369] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[368][370][369]\\n\\nExistential threats\\nMusk giving details about Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft at the 2006 Mars Society Conference\\nMusk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.[371] Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.[372][373] He has warned of a \"Terminator-like\" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.[374][375] In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.[376] Musk\\'s AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,[377][378] and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.[379]\\nMusk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI,[380] and has advocated for a carbon tax.[381] Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump\\'s stance on climate change,[382][383] and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump\\'s 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.[384] In 2021, Musk donated $100 million to fund a competition for new carbon removal ideas.[385] However, Musk\\'s lifestyle has been criticized for high greenhouse gas emissions,[386] and SpaceX has been found violating environmental regulations by repeatedly polluting waters in Texas.[387][388] In an interview with Trump in August 2024, in the lead-up to the 2024 United States presidential election, Musk tried to educate Trump on climate change,[389] supporting solar and nuclear energy,[390] but chose not to challenge Trump\\'s dismissive remarks on the issue.[391][392] In the same interview, Musk stated that the economy would collapse without oil and gas, repeating previous statements that it was wrong to \"vilify\"  the oil and gas industries.[390][393][394][395]\\nMusk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a \"multiplanetary species\".[396] He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.[397][398] He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.[399] Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline,[400][401] saying that, \"Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.\"[402] Speaking at The Wall Street Journal\\'s CEO Council session in 2021, Musk claimed that the supposedly declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[403] According to anonymous sources inside SpaceX speaking with The New York Times, Musk has repeatedly volunteered his sperm to help colonize Mars.[404] He denied the claim.[405]\\n\\nPolitics\\nMusk with Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson and President-elect Donald Trump on November 16, 2024\\nBy early 2024, Musk had become a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump.[406] By October 2024, he was Trump\\'s second-largest individual 2024 presidential campaign donor.[407] Musk\\'s views are generally described as right-wing and conservative.[408][409][410][411][412] While previously considered relatively apolitical and moderate, he has since shifted to the right and become more vocal about his views, notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022.[413] He is an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk has shared far-right misinformation[414][415][416] and numerous conspiracy theories.[417][418] Despite this, Musk still describes himself as politically moderate, rejecting the conservative label.[419]\\nMusk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans.[420] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest.[421] Beginning in the late 2010s, his political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[422]\\nMusk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election.[423] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.[424] He also endorsed Kanye West\\'s 2020 presidential campaign.[425] He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 US presidential election.[426] In May 2022, Musk said that he could \"no longer support\" the Democrats because they are the \"party of division & hate\",[427][428] and wrote a tweet encouraging \"independent-minded voters\" to vote Republican in the 2022 US elections.[429][430] That fall he gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee that ran advertisements in swing states attacking Democrats on issues such as transgender care and illegal immigration.[431] He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 US presidential election, giving $10 million to the campaign in 2023,[431] and hosted DeSantis\\'s campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[432][433][434] In August 2023, Musk suggested Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy should be the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket.[435]\\nAfter the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk wished Trump a speedy recovery and endorsed him for president.[436][437] In a July 2024 post on X, Musk shared a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump\\'s opponent in the 2024 presidential election, which appeared to show Harris saying she was the \"ultimate diversity hire\" and did not know how to manage the United States.[438] Musk wrote that the video was \"amazing\" and did not reveal that it was edited, despite X prohibiting \"synthetic, manipulated\" content \"that may deceive\".[438] In August 2024, Musk and Trump spoke for over two hours on a livestream on X, in which Musk suggested that Trump create a government efficiency commission which he offered to serve on.[439] Trump said he would \"love\" to have Musk involved and later said he needed Musk\\'s help to eliminate the Department of Education.[439] On September 15, 2024, after the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Musk wrote on X that it was odd that nobody had tried to kill Biden or Kamala Harris. He then deleted the post following widespread condemnation.[440] On September 19, the United States Secret Service announced that the agency was probing the post.[441] In October 2024, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally.[442] He has used his X account in support of Trump to repeatedly push falsehoods about immigration and voter fraud.[443][444] After becoming president-elect, Trump announced that Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would advise a new Department of Government Efficiency.[445]\\nMusk opposes a \"billionaire tax\",[446] and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders,[447][448] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,[449] and Elizabeth Warren.[450] He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase \"Hands up, don\\'t shoot\" was made up.[451][452] Musk promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.[453] He also used X to spread disinformation and \"election conspiracy theories\" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency\\'s relief efforts for Hurricane Helene.[454] Musk repeatedly used his platform on X to promote the claim that Democrats had been \"importing\" immigrants to vote for them. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger requested that X remove a fabricated video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant who had voted multiple times. Musk complied, but the video had already gone viral.[455]\\n\\nConservative PAC activities\\nIn July 2024, Bloomberg reported that Musk donated an unknown sum to the pro-Donald Trump America PAC, a super PAC;[456] in a later interview, Musk clarified that he created America PAC.[457] In October 2024, a Federal Election Commission filing showed that Musk contributed almost $75 million to his America PAC during the previous three months, and during that time, the PAC spent approximately $72 million to support Trump\\'s campaign.[458][459]\\nIn October 2024, Musk promoted a sweepstakes conducted by his America PAC, offering to pay $1 million per day to randomly selected registered voters in battleground states who signed a petition pledging support of the First and Second Amendments. Within days the U.S. Justice Department wrote America PAC warning that the sweepstakes might be illegal. Compensating people to register to vote violates federal law, and although registering to vote was not a condition to signing the petition, some legal analysts said the sweepstakes might induce people to register in order to participate. Musk\\'s defenders said signing the petition did not specifically induce people to register, although he had previously said registering voters was one of his goals in Pennsylvania and had begun describing prize winners as America PAC \"spokespeople\".[460][461] After receiving the Justice Department\\'s warning, Musk awarded two people $1 million each.[462] On October 28, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, sued Musk and America PAC.[463] Although Musk had originally said that the prize would be \"randomly\" awarded, his lawyer argued that recipients \"earn\" the money after being \"selected based on their suitability to serve as spokesperson for America PAC\". After an all-day hearing on November 4, the day before Election Day, the judge ruled that Musk could continue his daily giveaway.[464]\\nMusk provided over $50 million in 2022 to fund Citizens for Sanity, a group created by former Trump senior advisor Steven Miller to finance $93 million in advertisements related to culture war issues. The New York Times and OpenSecrets reported in October 2024 that some of Musk\\'s donations were routed through Building America\\'s Future, a hub of a dark money network supporting Trump. Building America\\'s Future created \"Progress 2028\", presented as the left\\'s response to Project 2025, that promoted misinformation about the agenda of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Musk has promoted the Fair Election Fund, which is heavily funded by Building America\\'s Future, and offers rewards for evidence of election fraud. That group is heavily involved in America PAC, founded and funded exclusively by Musk.[465][466][467][468]\\nIn October 2024, OpenSecrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, reported that Musk and other donors had reportedly funneled over $100 million into Building America\\'s Future, a dark money network backing Donald Trump. This network operates Progress 2028, a campaign posing as a pro-Kamala Harris initiative but aimed at undermining her support by spreading divisive and misleading information.[469][470]\\n\\nInternational politics\\nMusk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.[471] After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.[472]:\\u200a207–208\\u200a In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.[473][474] Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a \"special administrative zone\" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.[475][476][477]\\nIn October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and \"peace plan\" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine by allowing Russia to keep the Crimea Peninsula, while Ukraine would adopt a neutral status and drop the bid to join NATO.[478][479] It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian president Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.[480][481][482] Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.[483][484][485][486]\\n\\nMusk with Israeli president Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem, November 27, 2023\\nIn a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized Israel\\'s retaliatory actions in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war, saying that Hamas \"wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel\". He added that, \"if you kill somebody\\'s child in Gaza, you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli.\"[487] On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that X users who use terms such as \"decolonization\" and \"from the river to the sea\", or similar expressions that \"necessarily imply genocide\" of the Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.[488] Several weeks later, Musk traveled to Israel where he toured with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu the kibbutz Kfar Aza, site of one of the worst atrocities during the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. He described the experience as \"jarring\".[489]\\nIn August 2024, Musk criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amid the riots taking place in that country, saying, \"Shouldn\\'t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\".[490] Responding to a tweet with footage of the disorder that said the riots were due to the \"effects of mass migration and open borders\", Musk tweeted, \"Civil war is inevitable.\" His comments were condemned by Starmer\\'s official spokesman. Musk had previously restored far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson\\'s account (after Robinson had been banned under Twitter\\'s previous owners) and interacted with him on the platform.[491][492][493][494] Musk went on to refer to Starmer as \"two-tier Keir\" and ask, \"Why aren\\'t all communities protected in Britain?\".[495][496] Musk promoted a conspiracy theory that the UK government was planning to build detainment camps in the Falkland Islands to hold rioters.[497][498] In November 2024, he wrote that Britain was \"going full Stalin\" following the Labour government\\'s decision to end the inheritance tax exemption on agricultural assets worth more than £1 million.[499]\\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in October 2024 that Musk had been in regular contact with Vladimir Putin, Sergey Kiriyenko, and other high ranking Russian government officials since late 2022, discussing personal topics, business and geopolitical matters. The Kremlin denied the report, stating Musk and Putin had spoken only once.[500][501] The Journal reported that in one instance Putin had asked Musk to avoid activating his Starlink satellite system over Taiwan, to appease Chinese president Xi Jinping, according to a former Russian intelligence officer briefed on the situation.[502] Bloomberg and others had also previously reported in July 2023 that communications between Taiwan and SpaceX had broken down over the ownership of Starlink\\'s subsidiary in the country.[503][504] The communications with Putin were reported to be a closely held secret in government, given Musk\\'s involvement in promoting the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump. One person said no alerts were raised by the US government, noting the dilemma of the government being dependent on Musk\\'s technologies.[502] Democrat lawmakers and NASA administrator Bill Nelson stated that it should be investigated to find out if the report was accurate. \"We should investigate what Elon Musk is up to to make sure that it is not to the detriment of the national security of the United States\", elaborated Representative Adam Smith.[505] SpaceX officially responded via their X account stating, \"Starlink is not available [in Taiwan] because Taiwan has not given us a license to operate, and regulators declined to remove a requirement that a foreign entity own 51% of Starlink to operate there. SpaceX has not accepted such a condition for any market in which it operates.\"[506]\\nIn December 2024, it was reported that Elon Musk was planning to donate $100 million to Nigel Farage\\'s Reform UK party ahead of the next UK election, aiming to help Farage become prime minister. Musk, may route the funds through X\\'s UK branch to bypass donation laws.[507]\\n\\nGovernment advisory roles\\nUS president-elect Donald Trump announced on November 12, 2024 that Musk would become an inaugural leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a governmental advisory body that will \"slash excess regulations [and] cut wasteful expenditures\". Vivek Ramaswamy would be tasked with leading the department alongside Musk.[508][509]\\n\\nAccusations of antisemitism\\nThe Israeli government and several media outlets accused Musk of sowing antisemitism due to his promotion of George Soros conspiracy theories,[510] although some Israeli officials defended Musk and denied that his criticism of Soros constituted antisemitism.[511]\\nOn November 15, 2023, Twitter user Charles Weber, who identifies as a Jewish conservative, posted a video from StopJewishHate.org condemning the phrase \"Hitler was right\"; Weber captioned the video: \"To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting \\'Hitler was right\\': You got something you want to say? Why don\\'t you say it to our faces.\"[512][513] In response, a second user posted \"Okay. Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. I\\'m deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don\\'t exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.\" To this second user, Musk replied, \"You have said the actual truth.\"[512][513] Musk further clarified that he doesn\\'t believe that \"all Jewish communities\" hate white people, but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).[514] He added, \"You  [sic] right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL.\"[515]\\nThe first tweet was widely regarded as echoing white nationalist sentiments[516] and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push \"hatred against Whites\".[517][518] The following day, Musk made a tweet which critics regarded as supporting white pride.[519][520] Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets.[521]\\nAt the DealBook Summit on November 29, 2023, after comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger explaining his decision to stop advertising on X after Musk\\'s recent post, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin questioned Musk about the withdrawal of advertisers. Musk responded, \"I hope they stop. Don\\'t advertise\" and \"If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is\"; Musk singled out Iger, saying, \"Hey Bob, if you\\'re in the audience.\"[522][523] Musk acknowledged to Sorkin that one of his tweets—the one affirming an antisemitic conspiracy theory—was a mistake, saying, \"I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me and to those who are antisemitic and for that I am quite sorry.\"[524] Musk described his tweet as \"one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish, thing I\\'ve done\".[525][526]\\nIn January 2024, Musk visited the Auschwitz concentration camp with European Jewish Association Chairman Rabbi, conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.[527] He also spoke on a conference about rising antisemitism.[528] The New York Times described the trip as a part of an image \"rehabilitation tour\".[529]\\n\\nCOVID-19\\nMusk wearing a bandana as a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic, April 2021\\nMusk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[530][531] He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.[532]\\nIn March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[533][534] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the US population.[530] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero\" new cases in the US by end of April.[531] Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[535] Musk also falsely stated that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[536][537]\\nMusk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.[530][538][539] In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order,[540][541] and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.[541] In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.[542][543]\\nIn March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[544] After figures such as New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk\\'s offer,[545] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[544] However, Musk ultimately purchased and donated BiPAP and CPAP machines rather than ventilators.[546][547]\\nIn September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[548][549] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[550] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen\", which then trended on Twitter.[550][551] In December 2021, Musk said that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[552]\\n\\nPersonal life\\nMusk became a US citizen in 2002.[553] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[554] He then relocated to Austin, Texas, saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success.[554][555][556] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[557][558]\\nMusk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for a proposed fight with Mark Zuckerberg.[559] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.[560][561] Musk has stated he uses doctor-prescribed ketamine for occasional depression and that he uses it \"once every other week\",[562] while The Wall Street Journal has repeatedly alleged he uses it and other drugs recreationally.[563][564][565]\\n\\nRelationships and children\\nMusk has at least 12 children, one of whom is deceased.[1] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen\\'s University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[566] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[567] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family;[568] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[568] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children.[569][570]\\nIn 2022, the elder twin officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson,[571] reflecting her gender identity as a trans woman and using her mother\\'s surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[571] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists\", and has said that her gender transition is primarily what sparked his drive to \"destroy the woke mind virus\".[572][573] In a July 2024 episode of Jordan Peterson\\'s podcast, Musk said regarding Vivian that he had \"lost [his] son, essentially\" because of gender-affirming care. He commented: \"You know, they call it deadnaming for a reason. The reason it\\'s called deadnaming is because your son  is dead\", and went on to state that the eldest twin \"is dead, killed by the woke mind virus\".[574] Vivian responded publicly, criticizing Musk for lying about her and the circumstances of her transition; saying that Musk was \"cold\", \"quick to anger\", \"uncaring and narcissistic\", whose infrequent visits commonly involved him berating her for being feminine.[575] On November 7, 2024, in response to a news article about his daughter\\'s reaction to Trump\\'s win, Elon Musk wrote \"the woke mind virus killed my son.\"[576]\\nIn 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[577] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[578][579] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[580] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[580] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[581] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[582] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[583]\\nIn 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes said that they were dating.[584] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[585][586] Musk and Grimes originally gave the baby the name \"X Æ A-12\", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[587][588] which they then changed to \"X Æ A-Xii\".[589][590] They have received criticism for choosing such an impractical and difficult to pronounce name.[591]\\nIn December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter born via surrogacy.[592] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[593][594] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we\\'re very fluid.\"[592] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[595] In September 2023 it was reported that the pair had a third child, a son.[596] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son.[597][598][599]\\nIn July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had twins via IVF with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[600] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[601] Their third child together was born in early 2024 via surrogacy.[602][1] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[603] Musk denied the report.[604] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as \"an occasional girlfriend\".[605] In October 2024, The New York Times reported Musk bought a Texas compound for his children and the mothers of his children.[606]\\n\\nLegal matters after 2020\\nFurther information: Personal and business legal affairs of Elon Musk; List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc.; and Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\\nIn May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[607] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light.\" He accused the article from Business Insider of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[608][609] After the release of the article, Tesla\\'s stock fell by more than 6%,[610] and Barron\\'s wrote, \"...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[611]\\nIn April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein\\'s sex trafficking operation.[612] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[612]\\nMusk\\'s former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[613][614] On July 27, 2024, Grimes\\' mother accused Musk of withholding the passports of her grandchildren.[615]\\nBen Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a defamation lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant \"in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group\" near Portland, Oregon.[616][617][618] According to Brody\\'s complaint, one of Musk\\'s X posts promoted conspiracy theories that \"Ben Brody\\'s alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a \\'false flag\\' operation to deceive the American public\".[616] The complaint also alleged that Musk\\'s accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[616][617][619] In February 2024, Musk was ordered to testify in a deposition for the lawsuit.[620] In the deposition, Musk denied knowing who was suing him and admitted to doing no research on whether his claims were true. Musk attempted to keep the deposition from being made public.[621][622]\\nIn October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[623][624][625] Musk claimed the SEC was harassing him.[623][625] In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again.[626]\\nIn January 2024, Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk\\'s $55\\xa0billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.[627] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company\\'s board \"an unfathomable sum\" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\"[628] A re-ratification shareholders\\' vote passed in mid-June 2024, although much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed \"coercive tactics\" to move the vote in his favor.[629]\\nIn June 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported Musk had a \"romantic relationship\" with a former intern at SpaceX, confirmed with affidavits supplied by the intern\\'s lawyers who also represent Musk, and alleged that he had sexual relations with a woman who directly reported to him there. The article further alleges he also pursued sex with other SpaceX employees, and repeatedly asked an employee who reported directly to him to \"have his babies\".[630] In the same month, eight ex-employees, the same eight who were previously fired for penning an anti-Musk letter at SpaceX, filed a lawsuit against Musk alleging sexual harassment.[631]\\nAlso in June 2024, a former Twitter executive sued Musk for \"cheating\" him and other ousted executives out of $200 million in severance pay.[632]\\nIn August 2024, Musk sued advertisers for a boycott of X (formerly Twitter).[633][634][635] Later that month, Olympic boxer Imane Khelif filed a lawsuit for cyber harassment against X over alleged \"acts of aggravated cyber harassment\", in which Musk was named.[636]\\nIn October 2024, Musk and his America PAC were sued in Pennsylvania for allegedly operating an unlawful lottery before the 2024 US presidential election.[637] Musk\\'s lawyer argued the giveaway wasn\\'t a lottery since the recipients weren\\'t chosen by chance, leading one prosecuting attorney to call the effort a \"scam\" designed to influence the election.[638] in November 2024, he was sued again regarding the lottery[639] and two US senators called for a probe into alleged contacts with Putin.[640]\\n\\nPublic perception\\nFurther information: Elon Musk filmography and List of awards and honors received by Elon Musk\\nMusk (right) with then-President Barack Obama and  Air Force Colonel Lee Rosen at the Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40, launch site of the SpaceX Falcon 9, 2010\\nAlthough his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries up to current day, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Musk\\'s actions and his expressed views have made him a polarizing figure.[641] Biographer Ashlee Vance described people\\'s opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.[642]\\nMusk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008).[643] Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film\\'s 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2.[644] Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013),[645] Why Him? (2016),[646] and Men in Black: International (2019).[647] Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\", 2015),[648] The Big Bang Theory (\"The Platonic Permutation\", 2015),[649] South Park (\"Members Only\", 2016),[650][651] Young Sheldon (\"A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®\", 2017),[652] Rick and Morty (\"One Crew over the Crewcoo\\'s Morty\", 2019),[653][654] and Saturday Night Live (2021).[655] He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).[656][657]\\nAwards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008,[658] the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[659] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.[660] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University[661] and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership.[662] Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[663]\\nTime has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions: in 2010,[664] 2013,[665] 2018,[666] and 2021.[667] Musk was selected as Time\\'s \"Person of the Year\" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that, \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too.\"[668][669]\\nIn February 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[670]\\nIn 2024, Musk’s Royal Society membership was criticized by 74 members over his alleged anti-scientific behavior and promotion of misinformation, prompting debates about the society’s standards on membership and leading to Dorothy Bishop, a renowned neuropsychologist at University of Oxford, to resign over her dissatisfaction with the Society\\'s response.[671]\\nMusk has been described as an American oligarch due to his extensive influence over public discourse, social media, industry, politics, and government policy.[672]\\n\\nNotes and references\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n^ Musk remained on the board and served as an advisor.[74][75]\\n\\n^ SpaceX received nearly $900\\xa0million in Federal Communications Commission subsidies for Starlink.[105][106]\\n\\n^ Musk stated he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, an alleged reference to marijuana.[154] Members of Tesla\\'s board and rapper Azealia Banks alleged that Musk may have been under the influence of recreational drugs when he wrote the tweet.[155][156]\\n\\n^ He did not file the necessary SEC paperwork within 10\\xa0days of his stake passing 5%, a violation of US securities laws.[209]\\n\\n\\nCitations\\n\\n\\n^ a b c Alexander, Sophie; Hull, Dana (June 21, 2024). \"ELON WANTS YOU TO HAVE MORE BABIES\".

The automaker\\'s longest-produced model and second vehicle, critics have called the Model S one of the most significant and influential electric cars in the industry.\\nTesla started developing the Model S around 2007 under the codename \"WhiteStar\". Initially, Henrik Fisker—known for his work with Aston Martin—was appointed as the lead designer for the WhiteStar project, but after a dispute with Elon Musk, Tesla\\'s CEO, Fisker was replaced by Franz von Holzhausen. By 2008, von Holzhausen had designed what would become the production Model S\\'s exterior. Tesla unveiled a prototype of the vehicle in March 2009, in Hawthorne, California. To produce the Model S, Tesla acquired a facility in Fremont, California, which was previously owned by General Motors and Toyota. Series manufacture of the car officially began at what is now known as the Tesla Fremont Factory in June 2012. Tesla carried out the final assembly for European markets at its facilities in Tilburg, the Netherlands, between 2013 and 2021. \\nAll versions of the Model S come equipped with a single-speed transmission. The car initially used an alternating current induction motor, but in 2019, Tesla substituted it with a permanent magnet synchronous reluctance unit. Constructed mostly of aluminum, the Model S shares 30\\xa0percent of its components with the Model X—a crossover SUV that was introduced in 2015. Over the course of its production, it has undergone several updates, the most prominent ones occurring in 2016 and 2021. These updates have typically included modifications to the motor, such as changes to power or torque, as well as revised exterior elements and refreshed interior features. One such change included the introduction of Tesla Autopilot—a partial vehicle automation advanced driver-assistance system—which was released in 2015. To charge the Model S, Tesla operates a network of fast-charging stations.\\nIn 2015, the Model S was the world\\'s best-selling plug-in electric vehicle. It has been the subject of multiple fires, the first occurring in Kent, Washington, in October 2013. The car has earned numerous accolades, including being named one of the Best 25 Inventions of the Year 2012 by Time and receiving the Tech Car of the Year for 2012 award from CNET. In 2014, The Daily Telegraph described the Model S as a \"car that changed the world\".[6] Road & Track argued that, with the introduction of the Model S Plaid—the high-performance version of the vehicle—and features such as the yoke steering wheel, Tesla managed to turn the Model S into \"perhaps one of the worst [cars in the world].\"[7]\\n\\n\\nDevelopment[edit]\\nIn January 2007, a year before the company introduced its first vehicle, the Roadster, the American automaker Tesla Motors opened a facility in Michigan, employing sixty people to work on new projects, including a four-door sedan.[8][9] Beginning development under the codename \"WhiteStar\",[10] Tesla initially planned for the car to have two powertrain options. The first would be a battery-electric version with an all-electric range of 200 miles (320\\xa0km). The second was to be a hybrid electric vehicle with a range extender, capable of traveling between 40 and 50 miles (64 and 80\\xa0km) on electric power before a small gasoline engine would recharge its batteries and power the vehicle, giving it a total range of 400 miles (640\\xa0km). However, at the GoingGreen conference in September 2008, Elon Musk—the chief executive officer of Tesla[11]—announced that the company would exclusively produce battery-electric vehicles.[12]\\nIn 2007, Musk appointed Henrik Fisker, known for his work with Aston Martin,[13][14] as the lead designer of the WhiteStar project.[15][16] Fisker signed an US$875,000 contract to design the car.[17] The company requested that he design a \"sleek, four-door sedan\" priced from $50,000 (equivalent to $73,471 in 2023) to $70,000 (equivalent to $102,860 in 2023), and that it be ready between late 2009 and early 2010. Fisker owned a design studio in Orange County, California, which the Tesla employees frequently visited to view his designs. However, their reactions were generally negative; Ron Lloyd, the vice president of the WhiteStar project, described Fisker\\'s designs as \"terrible [...] some of the early styles were like a giant egg\". When Musk rejected his designs, Fisker attributed the decision to the project\\'s physical constraints, saying, \"they wouldn\\'t let me make the car sexy\".[18] Shortly after the meetings, Fisker started his own company[18] and debuted the Fisker Karma in 2008, at the North American International Auto Show.[19][20] Musk subsequently filed a lawsuit against Fisker, accusing him of stealing Tesla\\'s design ideas and using the $875,000 to launch his own company.[18][21] Fisker won the lawsuit in November 2008, and an arbitrator ordered Tesla to reimburse Fisker\\'s legal fees and declared Tesla\\'s claims to be without merit.[18][22]\\n\\nA dispute between Musk and Fisker arose after the latter started his own company and began producing the Karma (pictured).\\nA small team of Tesla engineers went to a Mercedes-Benz car dealership where they test-drove a CLS and an E-Class. Both cars shared a chassis, and the engineers assessed different aspects of the two vehicles, evaluating their positives and negatives. They ultimately preferred the CLS\\'s styling and used it as the baseline for the Model S. After purchasing a CLS, they disassembled it, modified the battery pack of a Tesla Roadster, cut out the CLS\\'s floor, and integrated it with the battery pack. They subsequently put all of its electronics and systems in the car\\'s trunk and replaced the interior. After three months of development, the engineers completed a battery-electric version of the CLS. They frequently tested the car on public roads. It had 120 miles (190\\xa0km) of all-electric range per charge and weighed more than the Roadster.[23]\\nIn August 2008, Musk appointed Franz von Holzhausen as the project\\'s lead designer.[24][25] Von Holzhausen reviewed Fisker\\'s sketches and clay models but was unimpressed with what he saw, stating that \"it was clear\\xa0[...] that the people [who] had been working on this were novices\". To save money, Tesla established its design center within a SpaceX factory—a company also owned by Musk. As von Holzhausen began designing the exterior of the Model S, Tesla engineers initiated a project to construct another electric version of a CLS. They stripped it to its core, removed the body structure, and extended the wheelbase by four inches (10\\xa0cm) to align with early Model-S specifications. Within three months, von Holzhausen had designed the production Model S\\'s exterior, and the engineers had begun building a prototype around the design.[26] Given the battery pack\\'s substantial weight, Musk and the team began efforts to minimize the weight of other components. To address this issue, Musk opted to use aluminum instead of steel, stating that the non-battery-pack portion of the vehicle must be lighter than equivalent gasoline vehicles. He noted that the primary challenge was that if aluminum were not used in its construction, the car\\'s performance would be compromised.[27] To accelerate the development of the Model S, one group of engineers worked during the day, while another arrived late evening and worked through the night, both operating within a 3,000 square feet (280\\xa0m2) tent in the SpaceX factory.[28]\\n\\nThe Model S prototype at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show\\nTesla debuted a prototype version of the Model S in Hawthorne, California, on March 26, 2009.[29][30][31] Tesla initially intended to manufacture the Model S in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and later in San Jose, California, but later withdrew from both plans mainly due to financial problems.[32][33] In 1984, the American automaker General Motors (GM) and the Japanese automaker Toyota partnered to form New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc., on the site of a former GM assembly plant in Fremont, California.[34][35] After the Great Recession, GM found itself trying to recover from bankruptcy. It decided to abandon the facility in 2009, with Toyota soon following.[36][37] However, a month after the last car was produced at the manufacturing line in April 2010, Toyota and Tesla announced a partnership and the transfer of the factory. Tesla agreed to purchase a significant portion of the facility for $42\\xa0million (equivalent $57\\xa0million in 2023), while Toyota invested $50\\xa0million (equivalent to $68\\xa0million in 2023) in Tesla for a 2.5\\xa0percent stake in the company.[35][38]\\nDuring the early 2010s, Musk expanded the engineering teams for the Model S, while von Holzhausen grew the design teams in Los Angeles. The engineers operated in a lab with forty-five personnel. The \"alpha\" version of the Model S, featuring newly stamped body parts from the Fremont factory, a revamped battery pack, and improved power electronics, was completed in the basement of an office in Palo Alto, California. Twelve of the cars were produced; some were sent to suppliers such as Bosch, while others were preserved for testing and design alterations.[39] On June 22, 2012, Tesla invited its employees, select customers, and the press to watch the first production Model S roll off the manufacturing line in Fremont.[40][41]\\n\\nDesign[edit]\\nThe Model S (left) and Model X (right) share a platform and 30\\xa0percent of their parts.\\nThe body and the chassis of the Model S are made mostly of aluminum.[42][43] The Model S shares its platform and thirty percent of its parts with the Model X,[44][45] a mid-size luxury crossover SUV that was introduced in 2015.[46][47] The Model S is a full-size sedan with four doors[48][49] and five seats;[50][51] a seven-seating option, however, was available.[52] The company claimed a drag coefficient of 0.24,[53] the lowest of any production car at release.[54] This claim was independently verified by the magazine Car and Driver in the middle of 2014.[55] The vehicle\\'s drag coefficient was improved by a solid front fascia instead of a grille, retractable door handles, and a flat underbody with no exhaust pipes to disrupt the airflow.[1]\\nThe Model S\\'s battery pack is its heaviest component[56][57] and is located inside of the car\\'s floor.[58][59] The battery pack consists of thousands of identical cylindrical 18650 battery cells, each measuring 18 millimeters (0.71\\xa0in) in diameter and 65 millimeters (2.6\\xa0in) in height.[60][61] These cells feature a graphite/silicon anode,[62] and a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode.[63][64] The Model S has a center of gravity height of 18 inches (460\\xa0mm),[65][66] reducing the risk of rollovers.[67][68] Since the heavier components of the drivetrain are positioned behind the rear axle\\'s centerline, the Model S has a weight distribution of 46\\xa0percent at the front and 54\\xa0percent at the rear.[69] The Model S has a single-speed reduction gear transmission,[70] and an alternating current induction motor. In 2019, Tesla replaced the induction motors with permanent magnet synchronous reluctance units.[71]\\nA cast aluminum cross-member attached to the vehicle\\'s body structure supports the front suspension and electrically assisted rack-and-pinion steering system. At the rear, a cast subframe is connected to the body using four rubber-isolated mounts to reduce vibrations.[72] The front suspension features a double control arm design, while the rear suspension uses a multi-link arrangement, each with an air spring for improved ride comfort.[72][73] This chassis also features disc brake components produced by Brembo.[72][74] Since the Model S lacks a front engine, Tesla implemented a \"frunk\"—a portmanteau of \"front\" and \"trunk\"—which has 5.3 cubic feet (150\\xa0L) of storage.[75][76] The car\\'s rear trunk possesses 26.6 cubic feet (750\\xa0L) of storage with the rear seats upright and 58.1 cubic feet (1,650\\xa0L) when the seats are folded down.[77][78] Initially, the seats and steering wheel of the Model S were offered in both synthetic and non-synthetic leather options. However, in 2017, following a request from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to become the first cruelty-free automaker, Tesla switched exclusively to synthetic leather.[79][80][81]\\n\\nModels and updates[edit]\\n2012–2016: Initial years[edit]\\nThe pre-facelift Model S\\nTesla allocated its initial 1,000 Model S units to the \"Signature\" limited edition configurations.[82][83][84] The AC induction motor of the base Signature model generates a power output of 270\\xa0kW (362\\xa0hp) and a torque output of 439 newton-meters (324\\xa0lb⋅ft).[85] The Signature Performance\\'s motor produces 310\\xa0kW (416\\xa0hp) and 601 newton-meters (443\\xa0lb⋅ft).[86][87] Both models incorporate an 85\\xa0kilowatt-hour (kWh) lithium-ion battery,[87][88] and have an all-electric range of 265 miles (426\\xa0km).[83][89][87]\\nBeginning in 2012, three battery pack configurations of the Model S were offered as 2013 model year[note 2] vehicles.[91] Initially, a 40\\xa0kWh lithium-ion model was planned as the entry-level version, but Tesla announced in 2013 that this version would not be produced.[92] The motor of this version was to produce a power output of 175 kilowatts (235\\xa0hp) and a torque of 420 newton-meters (310\\xa0lb⋅ft).[93][94][95] Instead, a more powerful model with a 60\\xa0kWh model—with its output limited to 40\\xa0kWh via software—was introduced to substitute the 40\\xa0kWh model.[93] Its motor generates 225 kilowatts (302\\xa0hp) and 430 newton-meters (317\\xa0lb⋅ft),[96] providing it with a range of 208 miles (335\\xa0km).[97] Two versions of the 85\\xa0kWh model were created: one with specifications similar to the aforementioned Signature model, and a performance version, the \"P85\", with specifications akin to the Signature Performance.[95][69]\\nIn 2014, Tesla discontinued the P85, replacing it with the P85D (\"D\" stands for \"dual\").[98][99] Tesla introduced a front motor in the P85D, in addition to the existing rear motor used in previous models. This configuration powers both the front and rear wheels, resulting in an all-wheel drive powertrain.[100][101] The two motors produce a combined output of 515 kilowatts (691\\xa0hp) and 931 newton-meters (687\\xa0lb⋅ft), giving it a range of 275 miles (443\\xa0km).[102][103] Replacing the 60\\xa0kWh model,[104][105] the 70D was introduced as a 2015 model year vehicle. It features dual motors that produce a combined output of 383 kilowatts (514\\xa0hp) and 387 newton-meters (285\\xa0lb⋅ft), allowing it to have a range of 240 miles (390\\xa0km).[106][107][108] A single-motor version of the 70\\xa0kWh model was also produced, with an output of 235 kilowatts (315\\xa0hp) and 325 newton-meters (240\\xa0lb⋅ft), giving it a range of 210 miles (340\\xa0km).[108]\\nIn 2015, Tesla launched the standard 90D and the performance P90D to succeed the 85 kWh model and the P85D, respectively.[109][110][111] The 90D\\'s motor produces 311 kilowatts (417\\xa0hp) and 658 newton-meters (485\\xa0lb⋅ft),[112][113] and a range of 288 miles (463\\xa0km).[113][114] The P90D\\'s dual motors generate a combined output of 568 kilowatts (762\\xa0hp) and 967 newton-meters (713\\xa0lb⋅ft),[115][116] sufficient to give the car a range of 268 miles (431\\xa0km).[116][117][118]\\n\\n2016–2019: First major update[edit]\\nThe Model S and its prominently revised front fasciaRear view\\nIn April 2016, Tesla implemented a facelift for the Model S, releasing them as 2017 model year vehicles.[119][120] Its most prominent update lies in its front fascia, where the previous black grille has been replaced by a continuation of the body, leaving only a thin gap between the leading edge of the hood and the bumper, which houses the Tesla logo.[121][122] The updated model also includes restyled, full-LED adaptive headlights that turn with the car to enhance visibility at night.[121]\\nThat same year, Tesla reintroduced the 60\\xa0kWh model and introduced an all-wheel-drive version, the 60D.[123][124] The former produces 235 kilowatts (315\\xa0hp) of power and 325 newton-meters (240\\xa0lb⋅ft) of torque, giving it a range of 210 miles (340\\xa0km).[125][126][127] The latter has dual motors that produce 242 kilowatts (324\\xa0hp) and 430 newton-meters (317\\xa0lb⋅ft), with a range of 253 miles (407\\xa0km).[128] Customers also had the option to upgrade the battery capacity to 75\\xa0kWh through an over-the-air update, extending the range by 40 miles (64\\xa0km).[125] In March 2017, Tesla discontinued the 60\\xa0kWh model to distinguish its premium cars from the cheaper options, making the 75\\xa0kWh model the new entry-level offering.[129][130]\\nIn late 2016, Tesla introduced the P100D as a replacement for the P90D.[131] The P100D\\'s motors generate a combined output 510 kilowatts (680\\xa0hp) and 1,072 newton-meters (791\\xa0lb⋅ft), allowing it to have a range of 315 miles (507\\xa0km).[132][133][134] In early 2017, Tesla introduced the 100D.[135] Its dual motors deliver 360 kilowatts (483\\xa0hp) and 660 newton-meters (487\\xa0lb⋅ft), and it has a range of 335 miles (539\\xa0km).[136][137] Midway through 2017, Tesla discontinued the 90D.[138] Tesla subsequently ended production of the rear-wheel-drive 75\\xa0kWh model in late 2017.[139] In 2019, Tesla also replaced the 75D, 100D, and P100D variants as part of the company\\'s shift towards a revamped model range.[140][141]\\n\\n2019–present: Simplified naming scheme[edit]\\nThe Model S in its 2021 design\\nIn favor of a more streamlined lineup, in 2019, the previous 75D, 100D, and P100D models were replaced with the Standard Range, Long Range, and Performance models, respectively;[141] however, the Standard Range model was discontinued later that year.[142] The Model S Long Range, equipped with a 100\\xa0kWh battery, has dual motors that generate a total output of 350 kilowatts (469\\xa0hp) and 730 newton-meters (540\\xa0lb⋅ft), giving the Long Range a range of 375 miles (604\\xa0km).[143][144] The Performance model also has a 100\\xa0kWh battery. Its dual motors produce a combined output of 562 kilowatts (754\\xa0hp) and 931 newton-meters (687\\xa0lb⋅ft); it has a range of 365 miles (587\\xa0km).[145] For 2020, the Long Range model was replaced with the Long Range Plus.[146] Its dual motors deliver a combined output of 311 kilowatts (417\\xa0hp) and 658 newton-meters (485\\xa0lb⋅ft). It has a range of 400 miles (640\\xa0km).[151]\\n\\nIn 2024, the Model S received restyled taillights. The Plaid model is pictured.\\nIn 2021, Tesla launched a significant update to the Model S, known internally as the \"Palladium\" project, which involved an overhaul of most of its components. The revised Model S was revealed in January 2021.[152][153][154] At its debut, the updated Model S had the lowest drag coefficient of any automobile, with a value of 0.208.[155][156] The updated Long Range delivers 500 kilowatts (670\\xa0hp). It achieves a range of 405 miles (652\\xa0km).[157] The Plaid, which features a 95\\xa0kWh battery,[158] has—in contrast to all models previous—a tri-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The trio produce a total output of 760 kilowatts (1,020\\xa0hp) and 1,050 newton-meters (770\\xa0lb⋅ft), providing the car with a 0 to 60\\xa0mph (97\\xa0km/h) acceleration of 1.98 seconds and a maximum speed of 200\\xa0mph (320\\xa0km/h), with a range of 390 miles (630\\xa0km).[159][160][161] In 2023, Tesla reintroduced the Standard Range model, which has a range of 370 miles (600\\xa0km).[162][163] By 2024, the Model S had received restyled taillights.[note 3]\\n\\nTechnology[edit]\\nFeatures[edit]\\nProduction dashboard with 12.3-inch\\xa0(310\\xa0mm) main dashboard digital display (left) and central 17-inch\\xa0(430\\xa0mm) touchscreen control panel (right)\\nThe instrument panel is positioned directly before the driver and features a 12.3-inch\\xa0(310\\xa0mm) liquid crystal display electronic instrument cluster.[50][165] Initially, the infotainment control touchscreen featured a 17-inch\\xa0(430\\xa0mm) multi-touch display[166] divided into four sections. The top section shows status icons and offers quick access to features like charging, HomeLink, Driver Profiles, vehicle information, and Bluetooth. Below that, the second section provides access to various apps, such as Media, Navigation, Energy, Web, Camera, and Phone. The central viewing area displays two active apps, split into upper and lower areas, with most apps expandable to fill the entire screen. The bottom section contains controls and settings for the vehicle, including doors, locks, lights, temperature settings, and a secondary volume control.[167]\\nOriginally, the Model S\\'s touchscreen was powered by a Nvidia Tegra 3 3D Visual Computing Module (VCM),[168][169] with a separate Nvidia Tegra 2 VCM handling the instrument cluster.[170] Around 2018, Tesla upgraded these two Tegra System-on-a-Chip (SoC) units to a single Intel Atom–based SoC, which powered both the main touchscreen display and the instrument cluster.[171] With the Palladium refresh, Tesla further updated the system, switching to a horizontal touchscreen orientation and an AMD Ryzen-based SoC. The touchscreen includes features like driver-side climate control, My App, the app launcher, recent apps, passenger-side climate control, and volume control.[note 4] Features, such as lock and unlock, trunk, glove box, and mirrors, could be controlled from the touchscreen.[172] Also for the 2021 refresh, Tesla implemented a \"yoke\" steering wheel.[173]\\n\\nAutopilot[edit]\\nIn 2014, Tesla introduced Autopilot, an advanced driver-assistance system developed by the automaker that amounts to partial vehicle automation.[174][175] Every Model S produced from September 2014 onward included the Autopilot hardware,[176] and it was officially released in October 2015 as a software update.[177][178] Autopilot uses cameras, radar and ultrasound to detect road signs, lane markings, obstacles, pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, traffic lights, and other vehicles. Additionally, Autopilot includes adaptive cruise control, lane centering, auto lane changing, autoparking and many other semi-autonomous driving and parking capabilities.[179][180] The Model S\\'s operating systems are partly built using open-source software (OSS), which is publicly available. Tesla uses OSS like Linux, the GNU toolchain, Buildroot, and community projects like Ubuntu.[181] From 2021, Tesla began using a system known as \"Tesla Vision\", which relies solely on cameras, replacing the previous radar-based sensors.[182] In 2023, Tesla discontinued the ultrasonic system as part of its shift towards Tesla Vision.[183]\\nThe Autopilot system has been the subject of criticism. Following a crash in Florida, the National Transportation Safety Board found that the driver\\'s usage of the system \"indicated an over-reliance on the automation and a lack of understanding of the system limitations\".[184] Tesla has faced accusations of misleading advertising, with critics alleging that the company led consumers to believe the vehicles were fully autonomous. Tesla has defended itself by arguing that the state\\'s prolonged lack of objection to the Autopilot branding implied approval of its advertising practices.[185][note 5] In a 2019 survey by Bloomberg News, hundreds of Tesla owners reported experiencing dangerous behaviors with Autopilot, including phantom braking, lane departures, and failure to stop for road hazards.[186] Users also noted issues like sudden software crashes, unexpected shutdowns, collisions with off-ramp barriers, radar failures, abrupt swerving, tailgating, and inconsistent speed changes.[187]\\n\\nCharging[edit]\\nA Model S connected to a Supercharger\\nSee also: Tesla Supercharger\\nTesla has devised numerous ways to charge the Model S: the 240-volt home wall charger provides 100\\xa0kilometers\\xa0(62\\xa0miles) of range per hour of charging, while the mobile connector, intended for use away from home, offers 50\\xa0kilometers\\xa0(31\\xa0miles) of range per hour.[188] Tesla partnered with businesses to install Tesla Wall Connectors to provide a public charging network called Tesla Destination.[189] The units are provided to the businesses by Tesla for free or at a cheap price.[190] The business is responsible for the cost of electricity. Some businesses limit them to customers, employees, or residents only.[191] In late 2012, Tesla began operating a network of 480-volt charging stations, dubbed \"Superchargers\".[192][193]\\nTesla initially planned for the Model S to allow fast battery swapping.[194][195] In 2013, the company demonstrated a battery-swap operation that took about ninety seconds—roughly half the time needed to refill a gas tank.[196][197][198] While Tesla initially planned to make battery swapping widely available, they reportedly abandoned the idea due to a perceived lack of customer interest.[199][200] Jeremy Michalek, a mechanical engineering professor, suggested that the high cost, bulkiness, and resource demands of batteries made the creation of extensive networks of swappable packs—requiring storage, charging, and maintenance—economically and environmentally impractical.[201] Critics have accused Tesla of exploiting California\\'s zero-emission vehicle credit system by introducing the battery-swap program without ever making it accessible to the public.[202] In 2020, Tesla announced plans to integrate the batteries into the vehicle\\'s body to enhance strength and reduce weight and cost.[203]\\n\\nEnvironmental impact[edit]\\nTesla claimed that the Gigafactory 1 is able to turn old batteries into new ones.\\nA 2015 study by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) concluded that in U.S. regions where the Model S is popular, its 68\\xa0percent higher manufacturing emissions are offset within a few years of average driving.[204] However, the UCS report assumes that electric materials are recycled at rates similar to other cars and excludes the issue of battery disposal due to limited data on recycling practices and future intentions at the time.[204] Over their lifecycle, electric vehicles—like the Model S—emit about half as much CO2 as comparable fossil fuel cars.[205]\\nAll Tesla Model S\\' initial lithium-ion batteries contained nickel and small amounts of cobalt,[206] which have a high environmental impact due to resource depletion, ecological toxicity, and extraction processes.[207] By early 2022, almost half of Tesla\\'s overall sales had shifted to a different battery type (LFP battery), which does not contain cobalt or nickel.[208] In 2021, Tesla wrote in its 2020 Impact Report that it recycles all returned battery packs and stated that Gigafactory 1 is able to recycle up to 92\\xa0percent of the elements from old batteries, moving towards a \"closed loop\" system where old batteries are turned into new ones. In 2020, the company recycled significant amounts of metals: 1,300\\xa0tons of nickel, 400\\xa0tons of copper, and 80\\xa0tons of cobalt.[209][210] Tesla\\'s report states that most of its batteries are recycled in some form; however, according to Vice, it does not specify that 92\\xa0percent of each individual battery is fully recycled. The company has articulated an ultimate goal of achieving \"high recovery rates, low costs, and low environmental impact\" through its recycling program, though it does not provide details on its current progress toward this.[210] A 2021 scientific study showed that the Tesla Model S is a profitable commercial battery pack for recycling due to its low disassembly costs and high revenues from cobalt recovery.[211] The materials scientist Dana Thompson from the University of Leicester cautions that the recycling of batteries may pose significant hazards. According to Thompson, if a Tesla cell is punctured too deeply or at an inappropriate location, it risks short-circuiting, potentially leading to combustion and the release of toxic fumes.[212]\\n\\nProduction and initial deliveries[edit]\\nThe vehicles that form the \"S3XY\" acronym: the Model S; the Model 3; the Model X; and the Model Y\\nThe Model S is the company\\'s second vehicle and is, as of 2022, its longest-produced model.[213][214] The Model S has been produced at the 5,400,000 square feet (500,000\\xa0m2) Fremont, California, facility since June 2012;[215][216] but from August 2013, for European countries, final assembly was carried out at Tesla\\'s facilities in Tilburg, the Netherlands.[217] The aim of the Tilburg factory was to shorten delivery times for customers in Britain and the EU, improve product quality, and establish the automaker\\'s presence in Europe by producing the Model S and the Model X.[218] The production of both the Model S and Model X at the Tilburg facility ceased in early 2021. According to the Dutch newspaper NU.nl, the 2021 refresh introduced changes to the production process that made it impossible to complete final assembly at the Tilburg location.[219] Tesla initially projected it would produce 1,000 units per month, aiming for a total of 5,000 units by the end of 2012. For 2013, Tesla aimed to quadruple that. Tesla built its 1,000th Model S by October 31, 2012,[220] and delivered 2,650 units by the end of the year.[221] In the first half of the subsequent year, 10,050 units were delivered to customers.[222]\\nThe Model S was the first vehicle by Tesla produced at the Fremont facility.[223] It was followed by the Model X in 2015, the Model 3 in 2017 and the Model Y in 2020.[224][225][226] These cars form the \"S3XY\" acronym.[227][228] In 2015, the Model S was the world\\'s best-selling plug-in electric vehicle,[229] with Tesla selling 50,366 in that year.[230] Since its inception, the Model S has been equipped with batteries supplied by the electronics company Panasonic in Japan.[231][232][233] Since January 2017, the car\\'s batteries have also been produced at Gigafactory Nevada.[234] European retail deliveries began between August and September 2013, with Norway,[235] Switzerland,[236] the Netherlands,[236] Belgium, France, and Germany.[237] The first Australian delivery took place in Sydney on December 9, 2014.[238][239] Deliveries to the mainland Chinese market began on April 22, 2014,[240] followed by Hong Kong in July 2014.[241][242] Deliveries to the United Kingdom began in June 2014.[243]\\n\\nSafety[edit]\\nTesting[edit]\\nIn a European New Car Assessment Programme testing conducted in 2022, the Model S received a five-star rating:[244]\\n\\n\\n\\nEuro NCAP test results\\nTesla Model S (2022) \\n\\n\\nTest\\n\\nPoints\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdult occupant:\\n\\n35.8\\n\\n94%\\n\\n\\nChild occupant:\\n\\n45.0\\n\\n91%\\n\\n\\nPedestrian:\\n\\n45.9\\n\\n85%\\n\\n\\nSafety assist:\\n\\n15.7\\n\\n98%\\n\\nIn a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) testing conducted in 2015, the Model S received a five-star rating.[245] Tesla subsequently claimed that—based on the details of the test—it actually achieved 5.4 stars, prompting the NHTSA to release a statement reaffirming that it does not award more than five stars, and that Tesla was \"misleading the public\" by claiming in their marketing that the NHTSA had awarded them a higher rating.[246][247]\\n\\n\\n\\nNHTSA\\n\\n\\nOverall\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrontal, driver\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrontal, passenger\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSide, driver\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSide, passenger\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSide pole, driver\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRollover\\n\\n / 5.7%[note 6]\\n\\n\\nRecalls[edit]\\nAs of February 2024, the Model S has had seven product recalls. On June 14, 2013, Tesla recalled Model S vehicles manufactured between May 10, 2013, and June 8, 2013, due to improper methods for aligning the left hand seat back striker to the bracket, which could weaken the weld between the bracket and frame. Musk stated that the weld had not detached on any car, there had been no complaints, and no injuries had occurred.[248] In early January 2014, Tesla issued a recall for Model S vehicles from 2013 due to the risk of overheating with the adapter, cord, or wall outlet during charging. Following the recall, Jerome Guillen, Tesla\\'s vice president of sales, announced that nearly all Model S adapters had already been updated via over-the-air software to address the charging problem. Tesla noted that the recall impacted nearly all Model S vehicles and adapters produced in 2013.[249] Tesla announced a voluntary recall on November 20, 2015, of all of its 90,000 Model S vehicles, to check for a possible defect in the cars\\' front seat belt assemblies. The problem was raised by one customer in Europe. Tesla\\'s resulting investigation was unable to identify a root cause for the failure, and the company decided to examine every car. Tesla reported that no accidents or injuries were related to the problem.[250]\\nOn January 20, 2017, Tesla recalled every Model S manufactured from 2012 because of defective Takata airbags. This recall not only impacted the Model S but also affected approximately 652,000 other vehicles from other automakers across the United States, which, at the time, was the largest automotive recall in the country\\'s history.[251] On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 of the 76,000 Model S and Model X vehicles sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes. Tesla assured that this issue was unlikely to cause safety problems and had not resulted in any accidents or injuries. Despite this, the company asked customers to have their cars inspected, a process that took about forty-five minutes. Approximately five\\xa0percent of the vehicles were affected, and Brembo, the supplier of the defective part, would cover the repair costs.[252][253] All 123,000 Model S cars manufactured before April 2016 were recalled on March 30, 2018, due to excessive corrosion of the bolts which secure the power steering, particularly those cars used in cold countries where roads are salted. Tesla\\'s stock dropped nearly four\\xa0percent in after-hours trading on Thursday following the announcement of the Model S recall.[254]\\nIn December 2021, 119,009 Model S vehicles produced between 2017 and 2020 were recalled because of the possibility of latch failure allowing front hoods to open unexpectedly. The recall, according to the company, affected around 14\\xa0percent of the Model S vehicles.[255] In February 2024, Tesla recalled over two\\xa0million Tesla vehicles in the United States due to the compact size of the warning lights on the instrument panel. Documents indicated that the recall was issued to enhance warnings and alerts for drivers. The NHTSA reported that the font size of the brake, park, and antilock brake warning lights was smaller than mandated by federal safety standards. This size made information difficult to read, thereby increasing the risk of a collision.[256]\\n\\nFires[edit]\\nSee also: Tesla Model S fire incidents\\nFirst fire[edit]\\nA fire involving a Tesla Model S occurred on October 1, 2013, after the vehicle struck metal debris on Washington State Route 167 in Kent, Washington.[257] The driver was alerted by the onboard system and was able to safely exit the highway, stop the car, and leave the vehicle without injury.[258] Tesla later explained that the fire was triggered by a \"direct impact of a large metallic object\" to one of the car\\'s 16 battery modules. The vehicle\\'s design, which included firewalls separating the modules, limited the fire to a small section at the front of the car.[257] The debris that caused the fire was identified as a \"curved section\" that had fallen off a truck and was recovered near the site of the accident. According to Tesla, the debris pierced a 3-inch (80\\xa0mm) hole through the vehicle\\'s 0.25\\xa0in (6\\xa0mm)  armor plate, with an estimated force of 25 short tons (23\\xa0t). Built-in vents directed the flames away from the passenger compartment, preventing them from entering the cabin.[258]\\nOn October 24, 2013, the NHTSA announced that it had not found evidence suggesting the fire resulted from a vehicle safety defect or noncompliance with federal safety standards.[259] However, in the following month, the NHTSA initiated a preliminary evaluation to assess the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes on 2013 Tesla Model S vehicles.[260] On March 28, 2014, the investigation was closed, with the NHTSA stating that \"Tesla\\'s revision of vehicle ride height and addition of increased underbody protection should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk\".[261][262]\\n\\nSubsequent fires[edit]\\nOn November 6, 2013, another fire occurred when a Tesla Model S struck a tow hitch on the road, causing damage to the underside of the vehicle.[263] In response to these incidents, Tesla extended its vehicle warranty to cover fire damage and issued a software update to increase the car\\'s ground clearance at highway speeds.[260] In early February 2014, another fire incident was reported in Toronto, Canada. The Model S was parked in a garage and was not charging at the time. The cause of the fire remains undetermined.[264][265] Tesla stated, \"in this particular case, we don\\'t yet know the precise cause, but have definitively determined that it did not originate in the battery, the charging system, the adapter or the electrical receptacle, as these components were untouched by the fire\".[266][267]\\nOn January 1, 2016, a 2014 Model S caught fire in Norway while supercharging unsupervised. The vehicle was totally destroyed but nobody was injured.[268] An investigation by the Norwegian Accident Investigation Board concluded that the fire started within the car, but the exact cause could not be determined.[269] In March 2016, Tesla announced that their own investigation found that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the vehicle\\'s distribution box, but the extent of the damage made it impossible to determine the exact cause.[270]\\n\\nReception and legacy[edit]\\n\\n\\nThe result is terrifying. Both terrifying to drive, and terrifying to realize that these things are out on the road, in the hands of a public I don\\'t trust enough to handle this sort of power. Up on Angeles Crest, the Plaid is incredibly quick, but it doesn\\'t have the chassis, steering, or brakes to deal with the horsepower. Especially irritating is the damping, which is never settled in the Plaid\\'s multiple drive modes. And that yoke steering wheel is just so incredibly stupid.\\n\\n\\n— Chris Perkins, reviewing the Plaid for Road & Track[7]\\n\\nThe Model S has been recognized by several critics as an influential electric car.[271][272][273] In a 2014 review for the newspaper The Sunday Times, Nick Rufford remarked, \"the Model S represents the last throw of the electric dice\\xa0[...] if this vehicle can\\'t persuade people to ditch petrol and switch to battery power, no car can\".[271] In December 2014, a journalist from The Daily Telegraph called the Model S \"a car that changed the world\".[6] The Daily Telegraph, in 2014, also called it \"the most important car of the last 20 years\".[274] The BBC-owned magazine Top Gear described it as \"one of the most appealing electric vehicles in the world\\xa0[...] and one that almost single-handedly forced mainstream manufacturers to embrace electricity\".[275] Keith Barry of Consumer Reports mentioned that \"the introduction of certain features, such as a yoke-style steering wheel, has distracted from the flagship sedan\\'s underlying brilliance, as has Musk\\'s public image\".[note 7][276] Consumer Reports additionally pointed out that the success of the Model S prompted other automakers to rethink how they design and market their vehicles.[276] The magazine Car and Driver noted that the Model S was the \"first long-range, widely desired electric vehicle\" when it was released, adding that \"mainstream automakers\\xa0[...] [struggled] to catch up\".[146]\\nThe Model S has received mixed reviews. Samuel Gibbs from the newspaper The Guardian referred to it as a \"swish saloon car\", writing that, unlike many other electric vehicles, it did not resemble \"a bug or bubble-car\". Gibbs was also impressed by its acceleration, remarking that it has \"it has enough power to beat even the Aston Martin Rapide, all without petrol and with no emissions\".[277] Reviewing for The Independent, Lee Williams called the Model S \"a beautiful car that symbolizes humanity\\'s march towards automation\", but criticized its large size, describing the car as \"too damn big\".[278] With the introduction of the Model S Plaid, the magazine Road & Track\\'s Chris Perkins argued that Tesla managed to turn the \"most important car of the century into a bad joke\", describing the Model S Plaid as \"perhaps one of the worst [cars in the world]\".[7] The newspaper U.S. News & World Report thought that its \"basic interior feels out of step with its price, and newer rivals offer more room, style and, in some cases, range\".[279] According to Lee Hutchinson of the news website Ars Technica, the Model S\\'s \"almond-shaped headlights and prominent nosecone conjure images of Maserati, while the rear half has a distinct Aston Martin DBS flavor, [and] the taillights and rear evoke the Jaguar XF\".[1] While being in two completely different classes, the Model S has been frequently compared to the first generation of the Nissan Leaf, a hatchback.[280][281]\\nArs Technica\\'s Lee Hutchinson called the vehicle\\'s acceleration \"instant, ludicrous, [and] neck-snapping\", believing that it was \"more appropriate for a roller-coaster than a car\". He described its styling as \"graceful, with a precisely engineered exterior\".[1] In his review for Carwow, Mat Watson described the Model S Plaid as \"astonishingly quick\" and \"extremely quiet\", but he criticized its high price and noted that competing models offer greater comfort. Watson ultimately rated it eight out of ten.[282] Keith Adams of the magazine Car described the Model S as \"the king of the hill\". He called the thrust \"stomach-churning from rest\", believing that the driver would \"crave to relive the experience—again and again\".[283] Jalopnik\\'s Lawrence Hodge criticized the yoke steering wheel, describing it as \"stupid\" and suggesting that its introduction was more of a downgrade than an upgrade.[284]\\n\\nAwards[edit]\\nThe Model S is the recipient of numerous awards, as listed in the table below:[note 8]\\n\\n\\nAccolades awarded to the Tesla Model S\\n\\n\\nOrganization\\n\\nYear\\n\\nCategory\\n\\nRef.\\n\\n\\nCNET\\n\\n2012\\n\\nTech Car of the Year\\n\\n[285]\\n\\n\\nTime\\n\\n2012\\n\\nBest 25 Inventions\\n\\n[286]\\n\\n\\nPopular Science\\n\\n2012\\n\\nAuto Grand Award Winner\\n\\n[287]\\n\\n\\nAutomobile\\n\\n2013\\n\\nAutomobile of the Year\\n\\n[288]\\n\\n\\nMotor Trend\\n\\n2013\\n\\nCar of the Year\\n\\n[289][290]\\n\\n\\nNatural Resources Canada\\n\\n2013\\n\\nEcoENERGY for Vehicles Awards[note 9]\\n\\n[291]\\n\\n\\nWorld Car of the Year\\n\\n2013\\n\\nWorld Green Car of the Year\\n\\n[292]\\n\\n\\nYahoo!

A device that stores energy is generally called an accumulator or battery. Energy comes in multiple forms including radiation, chemical, gravitational potential, electrical potential, electricity, elevated temperature, latent heat and kinetic. Energy storage involves converting energy from forms that are difficult to store to more conveniently or economically storable forms.\\nSome technologies provide short-term energy storage, while others can endure for much longer. Bulk energy storage is currently dominated by hydroelectric dams, both conventional as well as pumped. Grid energy storage is a collection of methods used for energy storage on a large scale within an electrical power grid.\\nCommon examples of energy storage are the rechargeable battery, which stores chemical energy readily convertible to electricity to operate a mobile phone; the hydroelectric dam, which stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy; and ice storage tanks, which store ice frozen by cheaper energy at night to meet peak daytime demand for cooling.  Fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died, became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels. Food (which is made by the same process as fossil fuels) is a form of energy stored in chemical form.\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nIn the 20th century grid, electrical power was largely generated by burning fossil fuel. When less power was required, less fuel was burned.[2] Hydropower, a mechanical energy storage method, is the most widely adopted mechanical energy storage, and has been in use for centuries. Large hydropower dams have been energy storage sites for more than one hundred years.[3] Concerns with air pollution, energy imports, and global warming have spawned the growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind power.[2] Wind power is uncontrolled and may be generating at a time when no additional power is needed. Solar power varies with cloud cover and at best is only available during daylight hours, while demand often peaks after sunset (see duck curve). Interest in storing power from these intermittent sources grows as the renewable energy industry begins to generate a larger fraction of overall energy consumption.[4] In 2023 BloombergNEF forecast total energy storage deployments to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 27 percent through 2030. [5]\\nOff grid electrical use was a niche market in the 20th century, but in the 21st century, it has expanded. Portable devices are in use all over the world. Solar panels are now common in the rural settings worldwide. Access to electricity is now a question of economics and financial viability, and not solely on technical aspects. Electric vehicles are gradually replacing combustion-engine vehicles. However, powering long-distance transportation without burning fuel remains in development.\\n\\nMethods[edit]\\nComparison of various energy storage technologies\\nOutline[edit]\\nThe following list includes a variety of types of energy storage:\\n\\n\\nFossil fuel storage\\nMechanical\\nSpring\\nCompressed-air energy storage (CAES)\\nFireless locomotive\\nFlywheel energy storage\\nSolid mass gravitational\\nHydraulic accumulator\\nPumped-storage hydroelectricity (a.k.a. pumped hydroelectric storage, PHS, or pumped storage hydropower, PSH)\\nThermal expansion\\nElectrical, electromagnetic\\nCapacitor\\nSupercapacitor\\nSuperconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES, also superconducting storage coil)\\nBiological\\nGlycogen\\nStarch\\nElectrochemical (battery energy storage system, BESS)\\nFlow battery\\nRechargeable battery\\nUltraBattery\\nThermal\\nBrick storage heater\\nCryogenic energy storage, liquid-air energy storage (LAES)\\nLiquid nitrogen engine\\nEutectic system\\nIce storage air conditioning\\nMolten salt storage\\nPhase-change material\\nSeasonal thermal energy storage\\nSolar pond\\nSteam accumulator\\nThermal energy storage (general)\\nChemical\\nBiofuels\\nHydrated salts\\nHydrogen peroxide\\nPower-to-gas (methane, hydrogen storage, oxyhydrogen)\\n\\nMechanical[edit]\\nEnergy from sunlight or other renewable energy is converted to potential energy for storage in devices such as electric batteries. The stored potential energy is later converted to electricity that is added to the power grid, even when the original energy source is not available. In pumped hydro systems, energy from the source is used to lift water upward against the force of gravity, giving it potential energy that is later converted to electricity provided to the power grid.\\nEnergy can be stored in water pumped to a higher elevation using pumped storage methods or by moving solid matter to higher locations (gravity batteries). \\nOther commercial mechanical methods include compressing air and flywheels that convert electric energy into internal energy or kinetic energy and then back again when electrical demand peaks.\\n\\nHydroelectricity[edit]\\nMain article: Hydroelectricity\\nHydroelectric dams with reservoirs can be operated to provide electricity at times of peak demand. \\nWater is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released when demand is high. \\nThe net effect is similar to pumped storage, but without the pumping loss.\\nWhile a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by lowering output in periods of excess electricity from other sources. \\nIn this mode, dams are one of the most efficient forms of energy storage, because only the timing of its generation changes. \\nHydroelectric turbines have a start-up time on the order of a few minutes.[6]\\n\\nPumped hydro[edit]\\nThe Sir Adam Beck Generating Complex at Niagara Falls, Canada, which includes a large pumped storage hydroelectricity reservoir to provide an extra 174 MW of electricity during periods of peak demand\\nMain article: Pumped-storage hydroelectricity\\nWorldwide, pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH) is the largest-capacity form of active grid energy storage available, and, as of March 2012, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) reports that PSH accounts for more than 99% of bulk storage capacity worldwide, representing around 127,000 MW.[7] PSH energy efficiency varies in practice between 70% and 80%,[7][8][9][10] with claims of up to 87%.[11]\\nAt times of low electrical demand, excess generation capacity is used to pump water from a lower source into a higher reservoir. When demand grows, water is released back into a lower reservoir (or waterway or body of water) through a turbine, generating electricity. Reversible turbine-generator assemblies act as both a pump and turbine (usually a Francis turbine design). Nearly all facilities use the height difference between two water bodies. Pure pumped-storage plants shift the water between reservoirs, while the \"pump-back\" approach is a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants that use natural stream-flow.\\n\\nCompressed air[edit]\\nA compressed air locomotive used inside a mine between 1928 and 1961\\nMain articles: Compressed air energy storage and Salt dome\\nCompressed-air energy storage (CAES) uses surplus energy to compress air for subsequent electricity generation.[12] Small-scale systems have long been used in such applications as propulsion of mine locomotives. The compressed air is stored in an underground reservoir, such as a salt dome.\\nCompressed-air energy storage (CAES) plants can bridge the gap between production volatility and load. CAES storage addresses the energy needs of consumers by effectively providing readily available energy to meet demand. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar energy vary. So at times when they provide little power, they need to be supplemented with other forms of energy to meet energy demand. Compressed-air energy storage plants can take in the surplus energy output of renewable energy sources during times of energy over-production. This stored energy can be used at a later time when demand for electricity increases or energy resource availability decreases.[13]\\nCompression of air creates heat; the air is warmer after compression. Expansion requires heat. If no extra heat is added, the air will be much colder after expansion. If the heat generated during compression can be stored and used during expansion, efficiency improves considerably.[14] A CAES system can deal with the heat in three ways. Air storage can be adiabatic, diabatic, or isothermal. Another approach uses compressed air to power vehicles.[15][16]\\n\\nFlywheel[edit]\\nThe main components of a typical flywheel\\nA Flybrid Kinetic Energy Recovery System flywheel. Built for use on Formula 1 racing cars, it is employed to recover and reuse kinetic energy captured during braking.\\nMain articles: Flywheel energy storage and Flywheel storage power system\\nFlywheel energy storage (FES) works by accelerating a rotor (a flywheel) to a very high speed, holding energy as rotational energy. When energy is added the rotational speed of the flywheel increases, and when energy is extracted, the speed declines, due to conservation of energy.\\nMost FES systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel, but devices that directly use mechanical energy are under consideration.[17]\\nFES systems have rotors made of high strength carbon-fiber composites, suspended by magnetic bearings and spinning at speeds from 20,000 to over 50,000\\xa0revolutions per minute (rpm) in a vacuum enclosure.[18] Such flywheels can reach maximum speed\\xa0(\"charge\") in a matter of minutes. The flywheel system is connected to a combination electric motor/generator.\\nFES systems have relatively long lifetimes (lasting decades with little or no maintenance;[18] full-cycle lifetimes quoted for flywheels range from in excess of 105, up to 107, cycles of use),[19] high specific energy (100–130\\xa0W·h/kg, or 360–500 kJ/kg)[19][20] and power density.\\n\\nSolid mass gravitational [edit]\\nMain article: Gravity battery\\nChanging the altitude of solid masses can store or release energy via an elevating system driven by an electric motor/generator. Studies suggest energy can begin to be released with as little as 1 second warning, making  the method a useful supplemental feed into an electricity grid to balance load surges.[21]\\nEfficiencies can be as high as 85% recovery of stored energy.[22]\\nThis can be achieved by siting the masses inside old vertical  mine shafts or in specially constructed towers where the heavy weights are  winched up to store energy and allowed a controlled descent to release it. At 2020 a prototype vertical store is being built in Edinburgh, Scotland [23]\\nPotential energy storage or gravity energy storage was under active development in 2013 in association with the California Independent System Operator.[24][25][26] It examined the movement of earth-filled hopper rail cars driven by electric locomotives from lower to higher elevations.[27]\\nOther proposed methods include:-\\n\\nusing rails,[27][28] cranes,[22] or elevators[29] to move weights up and down;\\nusing high-altitude solar-powered balloon platforms supporting winches to raise and lower solid masses slung underneath them,[30]\\nusing winches supported by an ocean barge to take advantage of a 4\\xa0km (13,000\\xa0ft) elevation difference between the sea surface and the seabed,[31]\\nDistrict heating accumulation tower from Theiss near Krems an der Donau in Lower Austria with a thermal capacity of 2 GWh\\nThermal[edit]\\nMain articles: Thermal energy storage, Molten salt, and Seasonal thermal energy storage\\nThermal energy storage (TES) is the temporary storage or removal of heat.\\n\\nSensible heat thermal[edit]\\nSensible heat storage take advantage of sensible heat in a material to store energy.[32]\\nSeasonal thermal energy storage (STES) allows heat or cold to be used months after it was collected from waste energy or natural sources. The material can be stored in contained aquifers, clusters of boreholes in geological substrates such as sand or crystalline bedrock, in lined pits filled with gravel and water, or water-filled mines.[33] Seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) projects often have paybacks in four to six years.[34] An example is Drake Landing Solar Community in Canada, for which 97% of the year-round heat is provided by solar-thermal collectors on garage roofs, enabled by a borehole thermal energy store (BTES).[35][36][37] In Braedstrup, Denmark, the community\\'s solar district heating system also uses STES, at a temperature of 65\\xa0°C (149\\xa0°F). A heat pump, which runs only while surplus wind power is available. It is used to raise the temperature to 80\\xa0°C (176\\xa0°F) for distribution. When wind energy is not available, a gas-fired boiler is used. Twenty percent of Braedstrup\\'s heat is solar.[38]\\n\\n Latent heat thermal (LHTES)[edit]\\nLatent heat thermal energy storage systems work by transferring heat to or from a material to change its phase. A phase-change is the melting, solidifying, vaporizing or liquifying. Such a material is called a phase change material (PCM). Materials used in LHTESs often have a high latent heat so that at their specific temperature, the phase change absorbs a large amount of energy, much more than sensible heat.[39]\\nA steam accumulator is a type of LHTES where the phase change is between liquid and gas and uses the latent heat of vaporization of water. Ice storage air conditioning systems use off-peak electricity to store cold by freezing water into ice. The stored cold in ice releases during melting process and can be used for cooling at peak hours.\\n\\nCryogenic thermal energy storage[edit]\\nMain article: Cryogenic energy storage\\nAir can be liquefied by cooling using electricity and stored as a cryogen with existing technologies. The liquid air can then be expanded through a turbine and the energy recovered as electricity. The system was demonstrated at a pilot plant in the UK in 2012.[40]\\nIn 2019, Highview announced plans to build a 50 MW in the North of England and northern Vermont, with the proposed facility able to store five to eight hours of energy, for a 250–400\\xa0MWh storage capacity.[41]\\n\\nCarnot battery[edit]\\nMain article: Carnot battery\\nElectrical energy can be stored thermally by resistive heating or heat pumps, and the stored heat can be converted back to electricity via Rankine cycle or Brayton cycle.[42] This technology has been studied to retrofit coal-fired power plants into fossil-fuel free generation systems.[43] Coal-fired boilers are replaced by high-temperature heat storage charged by excess electricity from renewable energy sources. In 2020, German Aerospace Center started to construct the world\\'s first large-scale Carnot battery system, which has 1,000\\xa0 MWh storage capacity.[44]\\n\\nElectrochemical[edit]\\nRechargeable battery[edit]\\nA rechargeable battery bank used as an uninterruptible power supply in a data center\\nMain articles: Rechargeable battery and Battery storage power station\\nA rechargeable battery comprises one or more electrochemical cells. It is known as a \\'secondary cell\\' because its electrochemical reactions are electrically reversible. Rechargeable batteries come in many shapes and sizes, ranging from button cells to megawatt grid systems.\\nRechargeable batteries have lower total cost of use and environmental impact than non-rechargeable (disposable) batteries. Some rechargeable battery types are available in the same form factors as disposables. Rechargeable batteries have higher initial cost but can be recharged very cheaply and used many times.\\nCommon rechargeable battery chemistries include:\\n\\nLead–acid battery: Lead acid batteries hold the largest market share of electric storage products. A single cell produces about 2V when charged. In the charged state the metallic lead negative electrode and the lead sulfate positive electrode are immersed in a dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4) electrolyte. In the discharge process electrons are pushed out of the cell as lead sulfate is formed at the negative electrode while the electrolyte is reduced to water.\\nLead–acid battery technology has been developed extensively. Upkeep requires minimal labor and its cost is low. The battery\\'s available energy capacity is subject to a quick discharge resulting in a low life span and low energy density.[45]\\nNickel–cadmium battery (NiCd): Uses nickel oxide hydroxide and metallic cadmium as electrodes. Cadmium is a toxic element, and was banned for most uses by the European Union in 2004. Nickel–cadmium batteries have been almost completely replaced by nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) batteries.\\nNickel–metal hydride battery (NiMH): First commercial types were available in 1989.[46] These are now a common consumer and industrial type. The battery has a hydrogen-absorbing alloy for the negative electrode instead of cadmium.\\nLithium-ion battery: The choice in many consumer electronics and have one of the best energy-to-mass ratios and a very slow self-discharge when not in use.\\nLithium-ion polymer battery: These batteries are light in weight and can be made in any shape desired.\\nAluminium-sulfur battery with rock salt crystals as electrolyte: aluminium and sulfur are Earth-abundant materials and are much more cheaper than traditional Lithium.[47]\\nFlow battery[edit]\\nMain articles: Flow battery and Vanadium redox battery\\nA flow battery works by passing a solution over a membrane where ions are exchanged to charge or discharge the cell. Cell voltage is chemically determined by the Nernst equation and ranges, in practical applications, from 1.0 V to 2.2 V. Storage capacity depends on the volume of solution. A flow battery is technically akin both to a fuel cell and an electrochemical accumulator cell. Commercial applications are for long half-cycle storage such as backup grid power.\\n\\nSupercapacitor[edit]\\nOne of a fleet of electric capabuses powered by supercapacitors, at a quick-charge station-bus stop, in service during Expo 2010 Shanghai China. Charging rails can be seen suspended over the bus.\\nMain article: Supercapacitor\\nSupercapacitors, also called electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) or ultracapacitors, are a family of electrochemical capacitors[48] that do not have conventional solid dielectrics. Capacitance is determined by two storage principles, double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance.[49][50]\\nSupercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and rechargeable batteries. They store the most energy per unit volume or mass (energy density) among capacitors. They support up to 10,000 farads/1.2 Volt,[51] up to 10,000 times that of electrolytic capacitors, but deliver or accept less than half as much power per unit time (power density).[48]\\nWhile supercapacitors have specific energy and energy densities that are approximately 10% of batteries, their power density is generally 10 to 100 times greater. This results in much shorter charge/discharge cycles. Also, they tolerate many more charge-discharge cycles than batteries.\\nSupercapacitors have many applications, including:\\n\\nLow supply current for memory backup in static random-access memory (SRAM)\\nPower for cars, buses, trains, cranes and elevators, including energy recovery from braking, short-term energy storage and burst-mode power delivery\\nChemical[edit]\\nPower-to-gas[edit]\\nThe new technology helps reduce greenhouse gases and operating costs at two existing peaker plants in Norwalk and Rancho Cucamonga. The 10-megawatt battery storage system, combined with the gas turbine, allows the peaker plant to more quickly respond to changing energy needs, thus increasing the reliability of the electrical grid.\\nMain article: Power-to-gas\\nPower-to-gas is the conversion of electricity to a gaseous fuel such as hydrogen or methane. The three commercial methods use electricity to reduce water into hydrogen and oxygen by means of electrolysis.\\nIn the first method, hydrogen is injected into the natural gas grid or is used for transportation. The second method is to combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide to produce methane using a methanation reaction such as the Sabatier reaction, or biological methanation, resulting in an extra energy conversion loss of 8%. The methane may then be fed into the natural gas grid. The third method uses the output gas of a wood gas generator or a biogas plant, after the biogas upgrader is mixed with the hydrogen from the electrolyzer, to upgrade the quality of the biogas.\\n\\nHydrogen[edit]\\nMain article: Hydrogen storage\\nSee also: Combined cycle hydrogen power plant and Hydrogen fuel cell power plant\\nThe element hydrogen can be a form of stored energy. Hydrogen can produce electricity via a hydrogen fuel cell.\\nAt penetrations below 20% of the grid demand, renewables do not severely change the economics; but beyond about 20% of the total demand,[52] external storage becomes important. If these sources are used to make ionic hydrogen, they can be freely expanded. A 5-year community-based pilot program using wind turbines and hydrogen generators began in 2007 in the remote community of Ramea, Newfoundland and Labrador.[53] A similar project began in 2004 on Utsira, a small Norwegian island.\\nEnergy losses involved in the hydrogen storage cycle come from the electrolysis of water, liquification or compression of the hydrogen and conversion to electricity.[54]\\nHydrogen can also be produced from aluminum and water by stripping aluminum\\'s naturally-occurring aluminum oxide barrier and introducing it to water. This method is beneficial because recycled aluminum cans can be used to generate hydrogen, however systems to harness this option have not been commercially developed and are much more complex than electrolysis systems.[55] Common methods to strip the oxide layer include caustic catalysts such as sodium hydroxide and alloys with gallium, mercury and other metals.[56]\\nUnderground hydrogen storage is the practice of hydrogen storage in caverns, salt domes and depleted oil and gas fields.[57][58] Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in caverns by Imperial Chemical Industries for many years without any difficulties.[59] The European Hyunder project indicated in 2013 that storage of wind and solar energy using underground hydrogen would require 85 caverns.[60]\\nPowerpaste is a magnesium and hydrogen -based fluid gel that releases hydrogen when reacting with water. It was invented, patented and is being developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials (IFAM) of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.  Powerpaste is made by combining magnesium powder with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at 350\\xa0°C and five to six times atmospheric pressure. An ester and a metal salt are then added to make the finished product.  Fraunhofer states that they are building a production plant slated to start production in 2021, which will produce 4 tons of Powerpaste annually.[61] Fraunhofer has patented their invention in the United States and EU.[62] Fraunhofer claims that Powerpaste is able to store hydrogen energy at 10 times the energy density of a lithium battery of a similar dimension and is safe and convenient for automotive situations.[61]\\n\\nMethane[edit]\\nMain article: Substitute natural gas\\nMethane is the simplest hydrocarbon with the molecular formula CH4. Methane is more easily stored and transported than hydrogen. Storage and combustion infrastructure (pipelines, gasometers, power plants) are mature.\\nSynthetic natural gas (syngas or SNG) can be created in a multi-step process, starting with hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is then reacted with carbon dioxide in a Sabatier process, producing methane and water. Methane can be stored and later used to produce electricity. The resulting water is recycled, reducing the need for water. In the electrolysis stage, oxygen is stored for methane combustion in a pure oxygen environment at an adjacent power plant, eliminating nitrogen oxides.\\nMethane combustion produces carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. The carbon dioxide can be recycled to boost the Sabatier process and water can be recycled for further electrolysis. Methane production, storage and combustion recycles the reaction products.\\nThe CO2 has economic value as a component of an energy storage vector, not a cost as in carbon capture and storage.\\n\\nPower-to-liquid[edit]\\nPower-to-liquid is similar to power to gas except that the hydrogen is converted into liquids such as methanol or ammonia. These are easier to handle than gases, and require fewer safety precautions than hydrogen. They can be used for transportation, including aircraft, but also for industrial purposes or in the power sector.[63]\\n\\nBiofuels[edit]\\nMain article: Biofuel\\nVarious biofuels such as biodiesel, vegetable oil, alcohol fuels, or biomass can replace fossil fuels. Various chemical processes can convert the carbon and hydrogen in coal, natural gas, plant and animal biomass and organic wastes into short hydrocarbons suitable as replacements for existing hydrocarbon fuels. Examples are Fischer–Tropsch diesel, methanol, dimethyl ether and syngas. This diesel source was used extensively in World War II in Germany, which faced limited access to crude oil supplies. South Africa produces most of the country\\'s diesel from coal for similar reasons.[64] A long term oil price above US$35/bbl may make such large scale synthetic liquid fuels economical.\\n\\nAluminum[edit]\\nAluminum has been proposed as an energy store by a number of researchers. Its electrochemical equivalent (8.04 Ah/cm3) is nearly four times greater than that of lithium (2.06 Ah/cm3).[65] Energy can be extracted from aluminum by reacting it with water to generate hydrogen.[66] However, it must first be stripped of its natural oxide layer, a process which requires pulverization,[67] chemical reactions with caustic substances, or alloys.[56] The byproduct of the reaction to create hydrogen is aluminum oxide, which can be recycled into aluminum with the Hall–Héroult process, making the reaction theoretically renewable.[56] If the Hall-Heroult Process is run using solar or wind power, aluminum could be used to store the energy produced at higher efficiency than direct solar electrolysis.[68]\\n\\nBoron, silicon, and zinc[edit]\\nBoron,[69] silicon,[70] and zinc[71] have been proposed as energy storage solutions.\\n\\nOther chemical[edit]\\nThe organic compound norbornadiene\\xa0converts to quadricyclane upon exposure to light, storing solar energy as the energy of chemical bonds. A working system has been developed in Sweden as a molecular solar thermal system.[72]\\n\\nElectrical methods[edit]\\nCapacitor[edit]\\nMain article: capacitor\\nThis mylar-film, oil-filled capacitor has very low inductance and low resistance, to provide the high-power (70 megawatts) and the very high speed (1.2 microsecond) discharges needed to operate a dye laser.\\nA capacitor (originally known as a \\'condenser\\') is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store energy electrostatically. Practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e., insulator). A capacitor can store electric energy when disconnected from its charging circuit, so it can be used like a temporary battery, or like other types of rechargeable energy storage system.[73] Capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries change. (This prevents loss of information in volatile memory.) Conventional capacitors provide less than 360 joules per kilogram, while a conventional alkaline battery has a density of 590 kJ/kg.\\nCapacitors store energy in an electrostatic field between their plates. Given a potential difference across the conductors (e.g., when a capacitor is attached across a battery), an electric field develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge (+Q) to collect on one plate and negative charge (-Q) to collect on the other plate. If a battery is attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time, no current can flow through the capacitor. However, if an accelerating or alternating voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor, a displacement current can flow. Besides capacitor plates, charge can also be stored in a dielectric layer.[74]\\nCapacitance is greater given a narrower separation between conductors and when the conductors have a larger surface area. In practice, the dielectric between the plates emits a small amount of leakage current and has an electric field strength limit, known as the breakdown voltage. However, the effect of recovery of a dielectric after a high-voltage breakdown holds promise for a new generation of self-healing capacitors.[75][76] The conductors and leads introduce undesired inductance and resistance.\\nResearch is assessing the quantum effects of nanoscale capacitors[77] for digital quantum batteries.[78][79]\\n\\nSuperconducting magnetics[edit]\\nMain article: Superconducting magnetic energy storage\\nSuperconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems store energy in a magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a superconducting coil that has been cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature. A typical SMES system includes a superconducting coil, power conditioning system and refrigerator. Once the superconducting coil is charged, the current does not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely.[80]\\nThe stored energy can be released to the network by discharging the coil. The associated inverter/rectifier accounts for about 2–3% energy loss in each direction. SMES loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems offer round-trip efficiency greater than 95%.[81]\\nDue to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the cost of superconducting wire, SMES is used for short duration storage such as improving power quality. It also has applications in grid balancing.[80]\\n\\nApplications[edit]\\nMills[edit]\\nThe classic application before the Industrial Revolution was the control of waterways to drive water mills for processing grain or powering machinery. Complex systems of reservoirs and dams were constructed to store and release water (and the potential energy it contained) when required.[82]\\n\\nHomes[edit]\\nMain article: Home energy storage\\nHome energy storage is expected to become increasingly common given the growing importance of distributed generation of renewable energies (especially photovoltaics) and the important share of energy consumption in buildings.[83] To exceed a self-sufficiency of 40% in a household equipped with photovoltaics, energy storage is needed.[83] Multiple manufacturers produce rechargeable battery systems for storing energy, generally to hold surplus energy from home solar or wind generation. Today, for home energy storage, Li-ion batteries are preferable to lead-acid ones given their similar cost but much better performance.[84]\\nTesla Motors produces two models of the Tesla Powerwall. One is a 10 kWh weekly cycle version for backup applications and the other is a 7 kWh version for daily cycle applications.[85] In 2016, a limited version of the Tesla Powerpack 2 cost $398(US)/kWh to store electricity worth 12.5 cents/kWh (US average grid price) making a positive return on investment doubtful unless electricity prices are higher than 30 cents/kWh.[86]\\nRoseWater Energy produces two models of the \"Energy & Storage System\", the HUB 120[87] and SB20.[88] Both versions provide 28.8 kWh of output, enabling it to run larger houses or light commercial premises, and protecting custom installations. The system provides five key elements into one system, including providing a clean 60\\xa0Hz Sine wave, zero transfer time, industrial-grade surge protection, renewable energy grid sell-back (optional), and battery backup.[89][90]\\nEnphase Energy announced an integrated system that allows home users to store, monitor and manage electricity. The system stores 1.2 kWh of energy and 275W/500W power output.[91]\\nStoring wind or solar energy using thermal energy storage though less flexible, is considerably cheaper than batteries. A simple 52-gallon electric water heater can store roughly 12 kWh of energy for supplementing hot water or space heating.[92]\\nFor purely financial purposes in areas where net metering is available, home generated electricity may be sold to the grid through a grid-tie inverter without the use of batteries for storage.\\n\\nGrid electricity and power stations[edit]\\nMain articles: Grid energy storage and Battery storage power station\\nRenewable energy[edit]\\n Construction of the Salt Tanks which provide efficient thermal energy storage[93] so that electricity can be generated after the sun goes down, and output can be scheduled to meet demand.[94] The 280 MW Solana Generating Station is designed to provide six hours of storage. This allows the plant to generate about 38% of its rated capacity over the course of a year.[95]\\n The 150 MW Andasol solar power station in Spain is a parabolic trough solar thermal power plant that stores energy in tanks of molten salt so that it can continue generating electricity when the sun is not shining.[96]\\nThe largest source and the greatest store of renewable energy is provided by hydroelectric dams. A large reservoir behind a dam can store enough water to average the annual flow of a river between dry and wet seasons, and a very large reservoir can store enough water to average the flow of a river between dry and wet years. While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from intermittent sources, it does balance the grid by lowering its output and retaining its water when power is generated by solar or wind. If wind or solar generation exceeds the region\\'s hydroelectric capacity, then some additional source of energy is needed.\\nMany renewable energy sources (notably solar and wind) produce variable power.[97] Storage systems can level out the imbalances between supply and demand that this causes. Electricity must be used as it is generated or converted immediately into storable forms.[98]\\nThe main method of electrical grid storage is pumped-storage hydroelectricity. Areas of the world such as Norway, Wales, Japan and the US have used elevated geographic features for reservoirs, using electrically powered pumps to fill them. When needed, the water passes through generators and converts the gravitational potential of the falling water into electricity.[97] Pumped storage in Norway, which gets almost all its electricity from hydro, has currently a capacity of 1.4 GW but since the total installed capacity is nearly 32 GW and 75% of that is regulable, it can be expanded significantly.[99]\\nSome forms of storage that produce electricity include pumped-storage hydroelectric dams, rechargeable batteries, thermal storage including molten salts which can efficiently store and release very large quantities of heat energy,[100] and compressed air energy storage, flywheels, cryogenic systems and superconducting magnetic coils.\\nSurplus power can also be converted into methane (Sabatier process) with stockage in the natural gas network.[101][102]\\nIn 2011, the Bonneville Power Administration in the northwestern United States created an experimental program to absorb excess wind and hydro power generated at night or during stormy periods that are accompanied by high winds. Under central control, home appliances absorb surplus energy by heating ceramic bricks in special space heaters to hundreds of degrees and by boosting the temperature of modified hot water heater tanks. After charging, the appliances provide home heating and hot water as needed. The experimental system was created as a result of a severe 2010 storm that overproduced renewable energy to the extent that all conventional power sources were shut down, or in the case of a nuclear power plant, reduced to its lowest possible operating level, leaving a large area running almost completely on renewable energy.[103][104]\\nAnother advanced method used at the former Solar Two project in the United States and the Solar Tres Power Tower in Spain uses molten salt to store thermal energy captured from the sun and then convert it and dispatch it as electrical power. The system pumps molten salt through a tower or other special conduits to be heated by the sun. Insulated tanks store the solution. Electricity is produced by turning water to steam that is fed to turbines.\\nSince the early 21st century batteries have been applied to utility scale load-leveling and frequency regulation capabilities.[97]\\nIn vehicle-to-grid storage, electric vehicles that are plugged into the energy grid can deliver stored electrical energy from their batteries into the grid when needed.\\n\\nAir conditioning[edit]\\nMain article: Ice storage air conditioning\\nThermal energy storage (TES) can be used for air conditioning.[105] It is most widely used for cooling single large buildings and/or groups of smaller buildings. Commercial air conditioning systems are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads. In 2009, thermal storage was used in over 3,300 buildings in over 35 countries. It works by chilling material at night and using the chilled material for cooling during the hotter daytime periods.[100]\\nThe most popular technique is ice storage, which requires less space than water and is cheaper than fuel cells or flywheels. In this application, a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile. Water circulates through the pile during the day to chill water that would normally be the chiller\\'s daytime output.\\nA partial storage system minimizes capital investment by running the chillers nearly 24 hours a day. At night, they produce ice for storage and during the day they chill water. Water circulating through the melting ice augments the production of chilled water. Such a system makes ice for 16 to 18 hours a day and melts ice for six hours a day. Capital expenditures are reduced because the chillers can be just 40% - 50% of the size needed for a conventional, no-storage design. Storage sufficient to store half a day\\'s available heat is usually adequate.\\nA full storage system shuts off the chillers during peak load hours. Capital costs are higher, as such a system requires larger chillers and a larger ice storage system.\\nThis ice is produced when electrical utility rates are lower.[106] Off-peak cooling systems can lower energy costs. The U.S. Green Building Council has developed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program to encourage the design of reduced-environmental impact buildings. Off-peak cooling may help toward LEED Certification.[107]\\nThermal storage for heating is less common than for cooling. An example of thermal storage is storing solar heat to be used for heating at night.\\nLatent heat can also be stored in technical phase change materials (PCMs). These can be encapsulated in wall and ceiling panels, to moderate room temperatures.\\n\\nTransport[edit]\\nLiquid hydrocarbon fuels are the most commonly used forms of energy storage for use in transportation, followed by a growing use of Battery Electric Vehicles and Hybrid Electric Vehicles. Other energy carriers such as hydrogen can be used to avoid producing greenhouse gases.\\nPublic transport systems like trams and trolleybuses require electricity, but due to their variability in movement, a steady supply of electricity via renewable energy is challenging. Photovoltaic systems installed on the roofs of buildings can be used to power public transportation systems during periods in which there is increased demand for electricity and access to other forms of energy are not readily available.[108] Upcoming transitions in the transportation system also include e.g. ferries and airplanes, where electric power supply is investigated as an interesting alternative.[109]\\n\\nElectronics[edit]\\nCapacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current while allowing alternating current to pass. In analog filter networks, they smooth the output of power supplies. In resonant circuits they tune radios to particular frequencies. In electric power transmission systems they stabilize voltage and power flow.[110]\\n\\nUse cases[edit]\\nMain article: United States Department of Energy International Energy Storage Database\\nThe United States Department of Energy International Energy Storage Database (IESDB), is a free-access database of energy storage projects and policies funded by the United States Department of Energy Office of Electricity and Sandia National Labs.[111]\\n\\nCapacity[edit]\\nStorage capacity is the amount of energy extracted from an energy storage device or system; usually measured in joules or kilowatt-hours and their multiples, it may be given in number of hours of electricity production at power plant nameplate capacity; when storage is of primary type (i.e., thermal or pumped-water), output is sourced only with the power plant embedded storage system.[112][113]\\n\\nEconomics[edit]\\nThe economics of energy storage strictly depends on the reserve service requested, and several uncertainty factors affect the profitability of energy storage. Therefore, not every storage method is technically and economically suitable for the storage of several MWh, and the optimal size of the energy storage is market and location dependent.[114]\\nMoreover, ESS are affected by several risks, e.g.:[115]\\n\\nTechno-economic risks, which are related to the specific technology;\\nMarket risks, which are the factors that affect the electricity supply system;\\nRegulation and policy risks.\\nTherefore, traditional techniques based on deterministic Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) for the investment appraisal are not fully adequate to evaluate these risks and uncertainties and the investor\\'s flexibility to deal with them. Hence, the literature recommends to assess the value of risks and uncertainties through the Real Option Analysis (ROA), which is a valuable method in uncertain contexts.[115]\\nThe economic valuation of large-scale applications (including pumped hydro storage and compressed air) considers benefits including: curtailment avoidance, grid congestion avoidance, price arbitrage and carbon-free energy delivery.[100][116][117] In one technical assessment by the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Centre, economic goals could be met using batteries if their capital cost was $30 to $50 per kilowatt-hour.[100]\\nA metric of energy efficiency of storage is energy storage on energy invested (ESOI), which is the amount of energy that can be stored by a technology, divided by the amount of energy required to build that technology. The higher the ESOI, the better the storage technology is energetically. For lithium-ion batteries this is around 10, and for lead acid batteries it is about 2. Other forms of storage such as pumped hydroelectric storage generally have higher ESOI, such as 210.[118]\\nPumped-storage hydroelectricity is by far the largest storage technology used globally.[119] However, the usage of conventional pumped-hydro storage is limited because it requires terrain with elevation differences and also has a very high land use for relatively small power.[120] In locations without suitable natural geography, underground pumped-hydro storage could also be used.[121] High costs and limited life still make batteries a \"weak substitute\" for dispatchable power sources, and are unable to cover for variable renewable power gaps lasting for days, weeks or months. In grid models with high VRE share, the excessive cost of storage tends to dominate the costs of the whole grid — for example, in California alone 80% share of VRE would require 9.6 TWh of storage but 100% would require 36.3 TWh. As of 2018 the state only had 150 GWh of storage, primarily in pumped storage and a small fraction in batteries. According to another study, supplying 80% of US demand from VRE would require a smart grid covering the whole country or battery storage capable to supply the whole system for 12 hours, both at cost estimated at $2.5 trillion.[122][123] Similarly, several studies have found that relying only on VRE and energy storage would cost about 30-50% more than a comparable system that combines VRE with nuclear plants or plants with carbon capture and storage instead of energy storage.[124][125]\\n\\nResearch[edit]\\nGermany[edit]\\nIn 2013, the German government allocated €200M (approximately US$270M) for research, and another €50M to subsidize battery storage in residential rooftop solar panels, according to a representative of the German Energy Storage Association.[126]\\nSiemens AG commissioned a production-research plant to open in 2015 at the Zentrum für Sonnenenergie und Wasserstoff (ZSW, the German Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research in the State of Baden-Württemberg), a university/industry collaboration in Stuttgart, Ulm and Widderstall, staffed by approximately 350 scientists, researchers, engineers, and technicians. The plant develops new near-production manufacturing materials and processes (NPMM&P) using a computerized Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. It aims to enable the expansion of rechargeable battery production with increased quality and lower cost.[127][128]\\nFrom 2023 onwards, a new project by the German Research Foundation focuses on molecular photoswitches to store solar thermal energy. The spokesperson of these so-called molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems is Prof. Dr. Hermann A. Wegner.[129]\\n\\nUnited States[edit]\\nIn 2014, research and test centers opened to evaluate energy storage technologies. Among them was the Advanced Systems Test Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in Wisconsin State, which partnered with battery manufacturer Johnson Controls.[130] The laboratory was created as part of the university\\'s newly opened Wisconsin Energy Institute. Their goals include the evaluation of state-of-the-art and next generation electric vehicle batteries, including their use as grid supplements.[130]\\nThe State of New York unveiled its New York Battery and Energy Storage Technology (NY-BEST) Test and Commercialization Center at Eastman Business Park in Rochester, New York, at a cost of $23\\xa0million for its almost 1,700\\xa0m2 laboratory. The center includes the Center for Future Energy Systems, a collaboration between Cornell University of Ithaca, New York and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. NY-BEST tests, validates and independently certifies diverse forms of energy storage intended for commercial use.[131]\\nOn September 27, 2017, Senators Al Franken of Minnesota and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico introduced Advancing Grid Storage Act (AGSA), which would devote more than $1 billion in research, technical assistance and grants to encourage energy storage in the United States.[132]\\nIn grid models with high VRE share, the excessive cost of storage tends to dominate the costs of the whole grid — for example, in California alone 80% share of VRE would require 9.6 TWh of storage but 100% would require 36.3 TWh. According to another study, supplying 80% of US demand from VRE would require a smart grid covering the whole country or battery storage capable to supply the whole system for 12 hours, both at cost estimated at $2.5 trillion.[122][123]\\n\\nUnited Kingdom[edit]\\nIn the United Kingdom, some 14 industry and government agencies allied with seven British universities in May 2014 to create the SUPERGEN Energy Storage Hub in order to assist in the coordination of energy storage technology research and development.[133][134]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\nEnergy portalRenewable energy portal\\n\\nEfficient energy use\\nEnergy storage as a service (ESaaS)\\nGrid energy storage\\nHybrid power\\nList of energy storage power plants\\nOutline of energy\\nPower-to-X\\nPower transmission\\nRenewable energy\\nThermal battery\\nVariable renewable energy\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ Clarke, Energy. \"Energy Storage\".

Elaborate Irrigation systems had been built In Egypt and Mesopotamia a thousand years before that, and it is very likely that these systems contained simple waterwheels. Waterwheels powered by a stream running underneath were common in the Roman Empire during the third and fourth centuries C.E. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, water technology advanced further in the Middle East than in Europe, but waterwheels were commonly used to harness water as a source of power in Europe during the Middle Ages. The Doomsday Book of 1086 C.E. lists 5624 water powered mills in the southern half of England. The designs of more efficient waterwheels were brought back to Europe from the Middle East by the Crusaders and were used for grinding grain and for powering furnace bellows.\\n\\n^ a b Guilherme de Oliveira e Silva; Patrick Hendrick (September 15, 2016). \"Lead-acid batteries coupled with photovoltaics for increased electricity self-sufficiency in households\".

(2017–present)Websiteteslaautomation.de/en/\\nTesla Automation GmbH (formerly Grohmann Engineering GmbH) is a German engineering automation company[2] based in Prüm in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The company operates a development center in Neutraubling, Bavaria, as well as support offices in Chandler, Arizona, and Shanghai, China.[3] The company was founded in 1983 by Klaus Grohmann and acquired by Tesla, Inc., in January 2017. Klaus Grohmann was ousted after clashing with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.[4]\\nThe product portfolio includes machinery for the production of microprocessors and memory chips, airbag sensors and power steering controllers, as well as systems for the production of car door and roof seals, lithium-ion battery cells and modules. Among other things, the company manufactures robotics that are used in the production of batteries and electronics.\\nThe firm works closely with universities within dual track studies of electrical engineering, electronics engineering , mechanical engineering and robotic process automation.[5] In addition, it provides training in the field of technical product design, industrial mechanics, CNC operation, construction technology, IT, mechatronics and industrial electronic technology.[6]\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nGrohmann Engineering was founded by Klaus Grohmann in 1963.[7] It moved its headquarters to Prüm in 1983.\\nIn November 2016, the privately held company agreed to be acquired by the American automotive company Tesla Motors.[7] At the time, 74.9% of the company was owned by Klaus Grohmann and 25.1% was owned by the Deutsche Beteiligungs AG.[8] At the time, the company had 700 employees,[7] with annual revenues of about €120 million.[9] The deal was completed on 3 January 2017, at which point the company employed 800 people.[10] According to a May 2017 SEC filing, Tesla paid $109.5 million in cash for the company, and in addition paid $25.8 million for a new incentive compensation agreement.[11]\\nIn April 2017, founder Klaus Grohmann left the company due to a dispute with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Musk demanded the company halt production for competitors, such as BMW and Daimler AG, to focus on the Model 3.[4]\\n\\nMain article: Tesla and unions §\\xa0Germany\\nBy discontinuing business relations with all customers except Tesla, the company\\'s trade union was concerned with wage levels and with jobs in the long term if electric cars did not have the expected success.[12] Tesla then offered Grohmann employees a raise of 150 euros per month and employee stock options worth $10,000 with a payout over the following four years, as well as a one-time cash payment of 1000 euros. Tesla did not comment on the works agreement.[13] In October 2017, the company agreed with union representatives on a competitive pay structure. According to the chairman of the works council, the future remuneration was at the level of the collective agreement valid for the industry.[14]\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ a b c \"Impressum\".

Channel\\xa011 began service as WTCN, an ABC affiliate, in 1953. It presented several notable children\\'s shows in its early years. After Time Inc. purchased the station in 1957, ABC switched affiliates, leaving channel\\xa011 to become an independent station that broadcast the Minnesota Twins baseball team, movies, and syndicated programs. By the late 1970s, WTCN was one of the nation\\'s most financially successful independent stations. On March\\xa05, 1979, channel\\xa011 became an NBC affiliate but struggled with its revamped newscasts. Between 1983 and 1987, the station moved from last to first in late news ratings, battling WCCO for two decades. It changed call signs twice in that period, to WUSA in 1985 and KARE in 1986, when owner Gannett moved the WUSA call sign to its Washington, D.C., station.

It is a migratory species, travelling to northern South America and the Caribbean during the Northern Hemisphere\\'s winter. The cinnamon teal lives in marshes and ponds, and feeds mostly on plants. It has a typical length of 16\\xa0in (41\\xa0cm), with a wing span of 22\\xa0inch (56\\xa0cm) and a mass of 14\\xa0oz (400\\xa0g). The male has bright reddish plumage with a duller brown coloration on the female. The bird feeds predominantly by dabbling, with its main diet being plants and sometimes molluscs and aquatic insects. This cinnamon teal was photographed at the Parrot World animal park in Crécy-la-Chapelle, France.\\n\\nPhotograph credit: Clément Bardot\\n\\nRecently featured: \\nMangosteen\\nThe Book of Fixed Stars\\nAfrican helmeted turtle\\n\\n\\nArchive\\nMore featured pictures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther areas of Wikipedia\\n\\nCommunity portal – The central hub for editors, with resources, links, tasks, and announcements.\\nVillage pump – Forum for discussions about Wikipedia itself, including policies and technical issues.\\nSite news – Sources of news about Wikipedia and the broader Wikimedia movement.\\nTeahouse – Ask basic questions about using or editing Wikipedia.\\nHelp desk – Ask questions about using or editing Wikipedia.\\nReference desk – Ask research questions about encyclopedic topics.\\nContent portals – A unique way to navigate the encyclopedia.\\n\\nWikipedia\\'s sister projects\\n\\nWikipedia is written by volunteer editors and hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization that also hosts a range of other volunteer projects:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommonsFree media repository\\n\\n\\n\\nMediaWikiWiki software development\\n\\n\\n\\nMeta-WikiWikimedia project coordination\\n\\n\\n\\nWikibooksFree textbooks and manuals\\n\\n\\n\\nWikidataFree knowledge base\\n\\n\\n\\nWikinewsFree-content news\\n\\n\\n\\nWikiquoteCollection of quotations\\n\\n\\n\\nWikisourceFree-content library\\n\\n\\n\\nWikispeciesDirectory of species\\n\\n\\n\\nWikiversityFree learning tools\\n\\n\\n\\nWikivoyageFree travel guide\\n\\n\\n\\nWiktionaryDictionary and thesaurus\\n\\n\\n\\nWikipedia languages\\n\\n\\nThis Wikipedia is written in English.

Take a look back at what happened on Wikipedia in 2024\\n\\n\\nThe nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation provides the essential infrastructure for free knowledge. We host Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, created, edited, and verified by volunteers around the world, as well as many other vital community projects. All of which is made possible thanks to donations from individuals like you.
